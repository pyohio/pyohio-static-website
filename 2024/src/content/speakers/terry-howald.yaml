biography: <p>I'm a physicist by training, but have spent my career working in software
  development and testing. I did teach physics for a bit, but now I just work in software
  development. I still enjoy physics though, and one of my interests is DIY energy
  storage. I've been an Ubuntu user since 2010. Unfortunately my current job requires
  me to work with Win, Mac, iPad, iPhone, and Android, but not Linux. I've been a
  C/C++ developer in the past, but now I'm insterested in Python and Rust for software
  development. My other interests include hiking, biking, kayaking, 1950s scifi movies,
  cooking, and Thai languange and culture.</p>
