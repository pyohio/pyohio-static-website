biography: <p>Bryan Raubenolt is a classically trained chemical and biomolecular engineer
  (B.S. – Tulane University), and computational chemist (M.S. and PhD – University
  of New Orleans) with an expertise in molecular simulations. He is currently a postdoctoral
  research fellow in the Blankenberg Group at the Center for Computational Life Sciences
  of The Cleveland Clinic’s Lerner Research Institute, where he develops open-source
  bioinformatics and cheminformatics software for the Galaxy Project. He is an active
  researcher at Discovery Accelerator, a joint center that utilizes Cleveland Clinic’s
  research and clinical expertise and IBM’s global leadership in computing technologies.
  He is part of a specialized team of researchers developing algorithms and attempting
  to use Quantum System One (QS1) to unlock the fundamental physics of life at the
  atom scale, hoping to help answer the oldest question in biology – how and why proteins
  adopt the shapes that they do.</p>
