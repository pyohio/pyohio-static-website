biography: '<p>In my sordid career, I have been an actor, bug exterminator and wild-animal
  remover (nothing crazy like pumas or wildebeests. Just skunks, snakes, and raccoons.),
  electrician, carpenter, stage-combat instructor, ASL interpreter, and Sunday school
  teacher. Oh, yeah, I''ve also worked with computers.</p>

  <p>While my first keyboard was an IBM selectric, and my first digital experience
  was on an Atari 400, my professional work in tech started in 1989 (when you got
  Windows 286 for free on twelve 5¼” when you bought Excel 1.0). Since then I''ve
  worked as a classroom instructor, courseware designer, helpdesk operator, desktop
  support staff, sysadmin, network engineer, and software distribution technician.</p>

  <p>Then, about 25 years ago, I got involved with monitoring. I''ve worked with a
  wide range of tools: Tivoli, BMC, OpenView, janky perl scripts, Nagios, SolarWinds,  DOS
  batch files, Zabbix, Grafana, New Relic, and other assorted nightmare fuel. I''ve
  designed solutions for companies that were modest (~10 systems), significant (5,000
  systems), and ludicrous (250,000 systems). In that time, I''ve learned a lot about
  monitoring and observability in all its many and splendid forms.</p>'
