biography: <p>Wayne has been a long-time Pythonista - they're "with blocks" years
  old in Python. In addition to Python, they've written production code in .NET, Java,
  and Javascript, but Python just fits his head better. In the past he's given talks
  at PyArkansas, SaltConf, and VMware Explore. He spent the last few years working
  on the Salt Project, and the last three years live-streaming the Salt Project Test
  Clinic. When not writing code, they can be found spending time with family, volunteering
  with dog rescues, building things, or working on their Wayne's Wonderarium channel
  on YouTube. But the best place to find him is on <a href="https://waynewerner.com">https://waynewerner.com</a></p>
