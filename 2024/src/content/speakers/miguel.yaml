biography: <p>I was born in Columbus, Ohio. I spent most of my childhood either drawing
  or taking apart electronics. While most kids asked for action figures and games
  for Christmas I was asking for tools and a soldering iron. I have 3 years of experience
  in tech, specializing in data engineering and software development. I am a father
  of 4 beautiful kids.</p>
