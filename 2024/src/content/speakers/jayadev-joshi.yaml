biography: <p>Currently, I am working as a bioinformatics researcher at the Cleveland
  Clinic, and my area of interest includes machine learning, big data, and NGS data
  analysis. I am developing new tools, workflow, and pipelines that can be easily
  integrated under Galaxy software (usegalaxy.org). I spend most of my time in writing
  programs using Python, and R to analyze high throughput data.</p>
