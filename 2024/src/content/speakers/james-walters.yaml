biography: <p>I started learning Python and Django in Fall 2021 with hopes that my
  colleague and I would be able to rebuild an aging internal web app. Today, that
  project is complete and in production, and my enthusiasm for Python is busting at
  the seams! It's a great privilege to return to PyOhio!</p>
