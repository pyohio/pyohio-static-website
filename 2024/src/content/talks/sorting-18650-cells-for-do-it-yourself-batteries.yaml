description: <p>Do-it-yourself batteries can be made with salvaged 18650 cells, but
  there are a number of steps to the process. First the cells must be extracted and
  tested. The test data are then stored and analyzed to create cell configurations
  for targeted battery sizes. Since a large number of cells are required to build
  nontrivial batteries, this process presents an excellent learning opportunity for
  data analysis. Here we examine how Python is leveraged to sort cell test data for
  battery creation.</p>
