description: <p>PyScript allows you to run Python code in a browser, like JavaScript
  does. It also lets you import geospatial mapping libraries like Folium and GeoPandas,
  all without actually installing anything! In this talk, we'll discuss the benefits
  and ease of using PyScript for this task, then we'll go through a basic geospatial
  analysis and display the results in a web map. In the end we'll have an app that
  can be easily shared, containing Python code that anyone can view and run.</p>
