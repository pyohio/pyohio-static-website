description: '<p>Okay you already enjoy using python, and you already enjoy using
  Discord, but what if you combined both! </p>

  <p>In this talk we will explore how to build a discord bot using the Pycord library.
  We’ll build a dice rolling bot that utilizes Discord’s native slash commands. At
  the end of this talk you’ll have learned the different ways to invoke discord bot
  actions, the different lifecycle events each bot goes through, structuring the code
  for maintainability, and how to build for widespread adoption.</p>'
