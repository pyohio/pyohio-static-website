description: '<p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) measures brain activity, and despite advancements
  in sensors since its 1924 invention, its result presentation has changed very little.
  We''re addressing this using MNE, an open-source Python library.</p>

  <p>Join us to simplify neuroimaging results for patients and enhance visualization
  tools for technicians. Affordable biotracking devices now capture brain wave data,
  and MNE enables innovative data export and manipulation. This opens new possibilities
  for advanced statistics, improved visualizations, and enhanced analysis capabilities.</p>

  <p>No medical background is required â€“ join us in revolutionizing brain activity
  interpretation, making it more accessible and meaningful for everyone.</p>'
