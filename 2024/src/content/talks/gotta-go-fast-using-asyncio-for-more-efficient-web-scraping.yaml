description: '<p>The internet has a wide variety of information available for human
  consumption. But this data is often difficult to access programmatically if it doesn''t
  come in the form of a dedicated API. With tools like Beautiful Soup, Python developers
  can parse data directly from web pages.</p>

  <p>There''s just one problem: looping through HTTP requests for a bunch of URLs
  one by one can take forever! Luckily, we can speed things up dramatically by making
  these requests asynchronous. In this live-coding adventure we will explore how to
  use asyncio to improve the performance of your web scraping endeavors.</p>'
