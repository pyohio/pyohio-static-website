description: '<p>Just like in other programming languages, floating number arithmetics
  is not very precise in Python.  What makes floats so special and weird that a simple
  arithmetic operation might not yield the expected result? Why is it so? For instance,
  what happens when you run the following line on the Python terminal: 0.1+0.1+0.1==0.3?
  What will be the output? True or False?</p>

  <p>This small talk will focus on the underlying behavior of floating arithmetics
  precision and then discuss a few potential solutions to the problem in Python.</p>'
