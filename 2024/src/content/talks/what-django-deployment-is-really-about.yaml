description: '<p>People often spend so much time learning how to build apps in Django
  that when it comes time for deployment, it feels like a whole new world that they
  don’t understand. Deployment recipes might help them get their app online–but then
  again they might not, if the steps that worked yesterday don’t work today. Even
  if they do get online, they might not understand that deployment process anymore
  than they did before.</p>

  <p>Instead of offering another set of steps, I think we can help beginners to make
  sense of deployment by reducing the entire process to four major areas of concern
  and equipping them to think through each of these on its own terms:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Static Files - why do I have to worry about these now? I thought {% static %}
  was handling it?</li>

  <li>Database - does my sqlite3 file not work in deployment? How do I use my cloud
  provider’s remote DB?</li>

  <li>WSGI Server - how do I run my app in production? Doesn’t manage.py runserver
  work? I’ve never heard of WSGI, what is it and why does it matter to my Django project?</li>

  <li>Web Server (Apache/nginx/PaaS) - What do I need to understand about web servers
  like Apache or nginx to get my project online? Do I even need to configure a web
  server if I go with PaaS?</li>

  </ul>

  <p>We’ll also consider:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Django’s deployment checklist</li>

  <li>django-simple-deploy</li>

  </ul>'
