description: '<p>Have you seen <code>pathlib</code>?  If not, once I show you, you
  will never go back to string paths and <code>os.path</code> ever again! <code>pathlib</code>
  turns paths into path objects, which have attributes and methods that cover a number
  of operations. In this talk, we will:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Talk about how to create <code>Path</code> objects, and how this differs on
  Windows vs Mac/Linux</li>

  <li>Talk about the many properties of pure paths</li>

  <li>Talk about folder operations from <code>Path</code> objects, such as creating
  directory structures and recursive globbing.</li>

  <li>Talk about file operations, made simpler with <code>Path</code> objects, such
  as reading contents, getting properties like file size, and deleting.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Stop messing with string paths and get with <code>pathlib</code>!</p>'
