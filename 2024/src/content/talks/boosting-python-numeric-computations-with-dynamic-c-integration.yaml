description: '<p>Uncover the secrets to turbocharging your Python numeric computations
  by harnessing the dynamic performance of <code>C++</code>. This talk is aimed at
  the beginner-intermediate Python developer working in the ML/AI infra or performance
  optimization space.</p>

  <p>Have you ever wondered how the growing usage of the numeric computation stack,
  including libraries like numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn, along with deep learning
  libraries such as pytorch and tensorflow, are shaping the future of AI and Machine
  Learning? And what about the intriguing fact that these libraries are built on wrappers
  for the underlying C++ code? Have you considered the benefits this brings, or how
  the optimization of these libraries as per the host device - be it CPU, GPU, or
  Apple Silicon - enhances performance and efficiency?</p>

  <p>And finally, let''s consider the practical applications and real-world examples
  of this integration between Python and C++. What are the challenges and solutions
  in bridging the gap between Python and C++ in the context of AI and Machine Learning.</p>

  <p>Observing the growing trends at my workplace over the past few years, I am sure
  this process is going to be standardised soon with more developers being involved
  in such integrations/optimizations.</p>

  <p>This talk aims to get the Python community excited for this growing trend by
  sharing:<br />
