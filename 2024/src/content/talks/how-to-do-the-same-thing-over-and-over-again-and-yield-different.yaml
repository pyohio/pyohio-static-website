description: <p>When I started working with Elasticsearch, the data in my index quickly
  needed to be updated. I built a solution using Cloud Functions and Cloud Scheduler
  in GCP to update my data automatically, a paradigm I've used for creative projects.
  This talk will outline strategies for automating routine processes while ensuring
  that the outcomes adapt to changing requirements, enhancing project innovation and
  data accuracy.</p>
