description: <p>Data engineering is an often misunderstood, conflated range of skills
  from database administration, analytics, ETL, cloud infrastructure, big data and
  back. As someone who worked as a data engineer for just over 5 years, Iâ€™d love to
  share my stories about my time as a data engineer to pull back the curtain on what
  kind of value you might be able to get from data engineering as the heat of ML Ops
  and AI takes flight, both as organization and individual. Notably, many data engineering
  teams heavily leverage Python due to the depth and breadth of the data libraries,
  and the ease by which folks can learn Python to start creating value within the
  space. We'll also talk about a few of the key libraries that you can learn to set
  yourself apart if you decide data engineering is for you!</p>
