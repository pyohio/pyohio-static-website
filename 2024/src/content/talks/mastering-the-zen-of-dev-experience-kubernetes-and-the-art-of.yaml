description: '<p>Happy developers do not have to fight their tools and environment
  to be productive. They get set up in minutes, deploy without hesitation, and use
  the same tools to debug in any environment. In this talk and live demo, we''ll explore
  how a Kubernetes-based development workflow can help you and your team hit the ground
  running.</p>

  <p>We will delve into establishing a powerful Django backend for server-side functionality
  and a dynamic React frontend for an engaging user experience. For databases, the
  setup will include a local Postgres database for development and CloudNativePG for
  production-level deployments. Additionally, the integration of Redis for enhanced
  application performance and email testing will be covered. </p>

  <p>This comprehensive approach ensures that onboarding a new developer on a project
  is streamlined, overcoming the typical pain points such as:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>manual installation steps </li>

  <li>the inconsistency of tools across development environments</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Kubernetes will empower your development and DevOps teams to speak a common language
  and collaborate effectively, standardizing deployments and debugging processes in
  local, preview, staging, and production environments.</p>'
