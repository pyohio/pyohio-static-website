description: '<p>The era of quantum computing is here. As it continues to evolve from
  being a technology in its infancy, to something that could revolutionize many aspects
  of daily life, it is capturing the interest of academia, government, and industry
  alike. It is thus of great importance for members of the scientific community to
  familiarize themselves with the theory and applications of this new computing method
  -- and especially how to program and develop algorithms on these devices.</p>

  <p>In this talk, we''ll take a look at the incorporation of Qiskit, IBM''s Python-based
  software stack for quantum computing, into the Galaxy ecosystem. We''ll revisit
  the basic theory of quantum computing along with the many important components of
  the coding framework and syntaxes, and we''ll explore a series of previously developed
  Qiskit tutorials and Jupyter notebooks, presenting new ways of solving some of the
  most relevant problems in contemporary science and engineering.</p>'
