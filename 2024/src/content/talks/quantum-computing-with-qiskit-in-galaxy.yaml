description: '<p>The era of quantum computing is here. As it continues to evolve from
  being a technology in its infancy, to something that could perhaps revolutionize
  many aspects of daily life, it is capturing the interest of academia, government,
  and industry alike. It is thus of great importance for members of the scientific
  community to familiarize themselves with the theory and applications of this new
  computing method, and most importantly, how to program and develop algorithms on
  these devices. Here, we introduce the incorporation of Qiskit, IBM''s python-based
  software stack for quantum computing, into the Galaxy ecosystem. The basic theory
  of quantum computing is revised in this talk, along with the many important components
  of the coding framework and syntaxes. We introduce a series of previously developed
  Qiskit tutorials and Jupyter notebooks, presenting new ways of solving some of the
  most relevant problems in contemporary science and engineering. </p>

  <p>One of the most anticipated applications for quantum computers remains in the
  enhancement of biophysics. To this end, many speculate that one of the first and
  most influential areas to be improved is in protein structure prediction. This is
  known as the "protein folding problem", whereby the primary amino acid sequence
  determines their 3D conformation. Why is this important? All biological activity,
  and by extension, all aspects of life (and disease), are the result of unique functions
  these proteins develop once they adopt this 3D structure. The computational complexity
  of this problem is insurmountable. We therefore hypothesize that quantum computers
  will have a significant advantage. This work culminates in the creation of a full
  biophysics Galaxy workflow: 1) the ab initio prediction of a protein conformation
  (a coarse grain, alpha Carbon trace backbone model), 2) the conversion of this quantum
  output into a conventional PDB format, 3) the posterior reconstruction of the protein''s
  full all-atom structure, 4) the application of a force field and creation of a physiologically
  relevant system, and 5) molecular dynamics simulations and subsequent analysis of
  this system. </p>

  <p>Bringing Qiskit into Galaxy will be an asset to researchers, educators, and trainees,
  allowing many to leverage this new technology to advance their own research efforts.
  Users will be able to readily run programs either on a simulator (emulating quantum
  circuits on a classical computer) or on actual quantum hardware on the backend (provided
  they have IBM credentials). We anticipate that over the next decade quantum computers
  will be more and more accessible to researchers. These new galaxy tools and workflows
  will thus help the community stay up to date and at the forefront of the quantum
  revolution.</p>'
