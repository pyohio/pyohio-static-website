description: '<p>What do NASA, Google Blogs, The Motley Fool, CFPB.gov, and the British
  National Health Service all have in common? Their websites are powered by Wagtail,
  the fastest-growing Python CMS that you''ve probably never heard of. Because it
  is 100% free and open-source, you can build your own website with Wagtail too!</p>

  <p>We''ll discuss:<br />

  * What is Wagtail and what does it do?<br />

  * How does it compare to other systems such as WordPress?<br />

  * Overview of the Wagtail open-source project. How a team of volunteers makes this
  all possible.<br />

  * Demo and brief getting started tutorial.</p>'
