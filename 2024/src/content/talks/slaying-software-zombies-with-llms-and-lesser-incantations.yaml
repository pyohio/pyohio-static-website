description: '<p>Code is organic: it grows and rots with neglect. So does the associated
  “meta-code” - like docs, tests, configurations, and requirements. This is fertile
  soil for Zombies, a horde of which can seriously disrupt the software development
  process. </p>

  <p>In this talk, we''ll explore how automated testing strategies can be used to
  identify and minimize drift in meta-code. Techniques of yore - such as Behaviour-Driven
  Development and Living Documentation - are resuscitated before your eyes using the
  arcane magic of Large Language Models (LLMs). Limitations / good targets for application
  are discussed in the context of the author''s experience. </p>

  <p>And if you act now, we''ll throw in two other hyphenated proper nouns (Provider-Driven
  Contracts and Example-Based Requirements) for free!</p>'
