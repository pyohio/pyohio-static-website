description: '<p>In this presentation, I''ll cover memory management in Python starting
  from the fundamentals. I''ll explain the rationale behind the need for PEP 683:
  "– Immortal Objects, Using a Fixed Refcount" , discussing about this change may
  be unlocking exciting avenues for true parallelism in python.</p>

  <p>The takeaway of this presentation would be :<br />

  a) Refresher on object(mutable vs immutable and their significance)<br />

  b) Refresher on Life cycle of a python object.<br />

  c) Refresher on python memory management with garbage collection<br />

  d) How overcoming with pseudo immutable object will be unlocking exciting avenues
  for true parallelism in Python.</p>

  <p>The target audience would be intermediate and advanced pythonistas. However I
  will present the information in simple and subtle manner for better understanding
  of python newbies .</p>'
