description: <p>Generators and Iterators are two core features of Python that are
  often misunderstood and overlooked.  And yet they are extremely powerful and expressive
  parts of the language.  They can be especially useful in data processing, systems
  integration, or in projects with limited resources.  In this talk, we'll get into
  the fundamentals of what iterators and generators actually are, how they're different
  from one another, and how they work under the hood.  We will explore how to create
  your own custom iterators and generators for use in your own projects.  Throughout
  the discussion, we'll make comparisons to the simple children's game "Snakes &amp;
  Ladders," and by the end of the talk we should have a simple working example of
  the game built with iterators and generators.</p>
