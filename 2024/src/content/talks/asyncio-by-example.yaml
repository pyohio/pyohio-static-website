description: '<p>Async functions in Python are a great way to simplify otherwise complex
  code involving network calls, database queries, or in general waiting and responding
  to "events". But before you can asycio.run you must learn how to walk-through some
  examples. </p>

  <p>This talk will start with the async/await basics, then show common patterns encountered
  when solving problems with Python''s asyncio module, and introduce some of its newer
  features, such as Barriers, TaskGroups, and ExceptionGroups.</p>

  <p>This is a code-heavy, zero-to-hero talk where all the examples are run, and we
  can experiment and change the code if the audience has questions.</p>'
