description: '<p>In open source projects, major changes to open source software are
  documented in Changelogs. Users can read the changelogs before updating their dependency
  to get a list of new features, bug fixes, and deprecations.</p>

  <p>But open source is not just about code, there is a community around it. Just
  like code gets improved and updated, other aspects of the community, like governance
  and infrastructure are also evolving, and yet such changes are usually more difficult
  to do and implement.</p>

  <p>This session discusses challenges in the Python open source community when it
  comes to making changes outside of code, and how us as a community can move forward
  to continue the evolution of Python as code and as community.</p>'
