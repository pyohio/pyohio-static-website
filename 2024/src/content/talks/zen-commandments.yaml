description: '<p>With the 20th anniversary of the Zen of Python coming up in August,
  now is the perfect time to reflect on how it has influenced the evolution of the
  Python language and how we write software in Python over the last 2 decades. Has
  Python moved closer to the ideals expounded in the Zen, or has it drifted further
  away? Like many great software engineering principles, different portions of the
  PEP are in contention with each other at times, which can be revealed in the features
  and patterns of the language. What does the current relationship between the language
  and the PEP say about the Python community and ecosystem as a whole, as well as
  perhaps the most important question: is the Zen of Python still relevant today?</p>'
