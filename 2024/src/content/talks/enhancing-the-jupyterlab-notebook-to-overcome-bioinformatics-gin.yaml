description: <p>My talk is focused on GiN, (Galaxy in Notebooks) is an open-source
  JupyterLab extension powered by the Galaxy API and JupyterLabâ€™s graphical widget
  interface. GiN provides a simple, GUI-based, user-friendly interface to interact
  with both local and public Galaxy servers from within JupyterLab. Galaxy (<a href="https://usegalaxy.org/">https://usegalaxy.org/</a>)
  is a widely used open-source web-based platform for accessible, reproducible, and
  transparent big data analysis in biomedical research. JupyterLab is a powerful tool
  for data scientists, researchers, and developers who want to work with data and
  code in an interactive and collaborative environment. GiN enables researchers to
  execute all available Galaxy tools graphically, submit jobs, access history datasets,
  upload large data files with resumable uploads, and explore job details and output.
  GiN can be used with a Docker image, making it easy to keep GiN up and running on
  a local machine. The GiN recipe includes Python, JavaScript, and Node.js modules,
  and can be downloaded from GitHub and installed with the pip package manager.</p>
