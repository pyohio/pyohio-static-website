description: <p>After creating a great web app using Python such as with flask, the
  next hurdle to production is how to make it available to users and operate it. And
  not just your app, but also ingress, the database, observability and the list goes
  on. We will go through your options for simplifying the operations of your web app
  using open source tooling. This will include using k8s directly, helm charts, IaaC
  using pulumi and new tooling developed by Canonical using juju. By the end of the
  talk you will have seen the benefits and drawbacks of each which will help you make
  an informed decision on which tool best suits your needs!</p>
