description: <p>Utilizing the Python programming language and the Tkinter library,
  I propose to develop a simulated robotic application tailored for search and rescue
  missions. Central to this endeavor is the integration of a neural network, trained
  on pertinent search and rescue data, to effectively guide the robotic agent towards
  areas with a high probability of locating survivors. The neural network's computations
  yield a dynamic cost map, which takes into account both traversal costs and the
  priority of various regions within the search area. This cost map serves as a comprehensive
  tool, continuously furnishing the robotic agent with insights into the search region
  and optimizing its search strategy. Importantly, this approach is conceived to address
  challenges inherent in reinforcement learning, such as the lack of a global view
  and the need to balance multiple objectives in search and rescue mission.</p>
