description: '<p>Data science and Agile aren''t famous for getting along. Data scientists
  complain that Agile frameworks are too restrictive and deadline-focused to accommodate
  the type of work they do. Scrum masters and product owners have a hard timing planning
  around unclear timelines and uncertain outcomes, and wish the data scientists would
  just tell them how much effort a task will take.</p>

  <p>But it doesn''t have to be this way! Data science and Agile can work together
  to create a better system for everyone. In this talk I''ll highlight tips and pitfalls
  from my own experience, as well as stories I''ve heard from my colleagues.</p>'
