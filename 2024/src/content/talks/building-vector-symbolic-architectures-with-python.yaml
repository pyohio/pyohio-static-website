description: '<p>Vector-Symbolic Architectures (a.k.a. Hyperdimensional Computing)
  is a relatively new computational paradigm that involves the use of random vectors
  in a high-dimensional space to represent and process information. As a computational
  paradigm, it finds applications in a wide range of fields, including artificial
  intelligence, natural language processing, internet-of-things, robotics, bioinformatics,
  and other scientific domains.</p>

  <p>Here we are going to introduce some fundamental concepts at the base of Hyperdimensional
  Computing, following a presentation of <em>hdlib</em>, a library for building Vector-Symbolic
  Architectures with Python. Finally, we are going to see how to easily build a machine
  learning model based on the Hyperdimensional Computing paradigm as a practical use
  case.</p>

  <p>As a reference, <em>hdlib</em> is open-source, it is available on GitHub at <a
  href="https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib"><a href="https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib">https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib</a></a>,
  and it is published on the Journal of Open Source Software at <a href="https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.05704"><a
