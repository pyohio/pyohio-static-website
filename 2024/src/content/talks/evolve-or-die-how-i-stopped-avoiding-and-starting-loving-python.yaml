description: '<p>Imagine you’re all set to board a flight. You''ve got your book and
  snack, and you''re nestled into your seat. The pilot assures you of a smooth journey
  ahead. Comforting, right? But for hundreds of thousands of airline passengers last
  holiday season, the reality was far from comforting. Remember the chaos? A major
  airline canceled around 17,000 flights due to outdated software in their crew scheduling
  system, leaving pilots clueless about their assignments.</p>

  <p>The fallout was severe: a 15% plummet in share price, a $400 million hit to revenue,
  and about $300 million in compensation costs—not to mention the lasting stain on
  their reputation.</p>

  <p>Now, let’s turn to you. What upgrades are you putting off? What will it cost
  you to delay?</p>

  <p>Fear of the unknown is a major driver of delaying upgrades and inadvertently
  risking security. Which deprecations in the standard library actually affect me?
  Do my packages support the next version of Python? If I upgrade one package, which
  other packages are affected?</p>

  <p>In my talk, I will demo how new tools—data that can be leveraged directly through
  Snowflake or through an app that also parses <code>requirements.txt</code> to do
  even more of the heavy lifting—can help the audience navigate minefields of Python
  upgrades and get to the latest Python version. The audience will also leave with
  practical, required actions for Python deprecations on popular platforms: AWS, Heroku,
  and AZURE.</p>'
