# Volunteer

PyOhio only happens thanks to the work of manu volunteers. Want to help?

## Talk Proposal Reviewers

During the CFP process, we need volunteers to help us review talk proposals. PyOhio aims to showcase talks on a wide variety of topics to an aucidence made of all different experience levels. No specific experience is necessary and instructions will be provided. If you're interested in attending PyOhio you're qualified to review proposals!

## On-Site Volunteers

During the event we need volunteers to help with all sorts of things: signage, registration, session chairs (introduce talks), t-shirt distribution, videoagraphy assistant, etc. We'll brief you on the role before you get started.
