As we return to an in-person event after several years of streamed short talks, it’s also time to change up our format. This year’s PyOhio will once again feature multiple full-sized talk tracks, with most talks approximately 30 minutes long.

We're looking for talks on any topics of interest to Python users! That might mean teaching us about new language features, showing off cool things you can do with a particular library, a case study about a problem you've solved with Python, creative hobby uses for Python, as well as broader topics like application deployment, packaging, testing, security, professional skills, and more!

**Need inspiration?** Take a look at the talk descriptions and videos from previous years:

- [PyOhio 2023 Talk Descriptions](https://www.pyohio.org/2023/talks/schedule/) (our most recent online event)
- [PyOhio 2023 Talk Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2k6bbM_wgjvpaFWOp1Jao78LqMzlZ3Gl)
- [PyOhio 2019 Talk Descriptions](https://www.pyohio.org/2019/events/talks) (our most recent in-person event)
- [PyOhio 2019 Talk Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2k6bbM_wgjunoCzex5Sbn3p1r7PFuZ8X)

**Have lots of ideas?** Send us your best -- PyOhio will consider up to three talks per speaker.

All speakers and participants must agree to abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://www.pyohio.org/code-of-conduct/).
