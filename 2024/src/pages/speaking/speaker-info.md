# Information for Speakers

## Presentation Guidelines

We will provide guildelines screen resolutions and connectivity options after we confirm details with the venue A/V staff.

## Speakers

PyOhio is dedicated to featuring a diverse and inclusive speaker lineup.

**All speakers will be expected to have read and adhere to the
conference [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct). In particular for
speakers: slide contents and spoken material should be appropriate for a
professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate, and neither are language
or imagery that denigrate or demean people based on race, gender,
religion, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability, or body
size.**

PyOhio does not tolerate plagiarism. Speakers' presentations must be
their own, original material, with appropriate citations when incorporating
the work of others.

We will make every effort to provide accommodations for speakers and
attendees of all abilities -- all we ask is that you let us know so we
can prepare accordingly.

PyOhio is a conference in support of the local programmer community. We
aim to feature a mix of local and non-local speakers to offer a program
with broad appeal.
