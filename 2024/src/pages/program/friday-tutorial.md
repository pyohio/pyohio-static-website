# Learn Python with Your Face

_Beginner Tutorial_

_Friday at 6pm-8pm in Orchid Ballroom_

**Separate registration required**

<br>

This beginner tutorial will be a gentle hands-on introduction to Python programming by playing with photos.

If you're curious about PyOhio but you don't know Python yet, don't let that stop you! Join our hands-on tutorial. You'll get familiar with basic Python concepts in a fun way, manipulating photos. You could be your own meme!

Bring a laptop with Internet access and a web browser - that's all! No software installation required.

This will be held in the Orchid Ballroom on the 6th floor of the Westin Cleveland Downtown the Friday evening before the main conference.

This is limited to 30 attendees and separate registration is required. Registration opens Tuesday, Jul 23 at 10am ET at [PyOhio Tutorial Registration](https://ti.to/pyohio/2024/with/friday-beginner-tutorial-learn-python-with-your-face). This does not include conference registration so please [register for the conference](https://ti.to/pyohio/2024/) separately.
