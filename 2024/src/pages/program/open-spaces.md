# Open Spaces

Open Spaces are self-organized meetups that take place in dedicated rooms throughout the conference. Topics are defined and discussion is self-organized by attendees rather than conference organizers.

Anyone can participate in an Open Space and anyone can host one. Information about posting an Open Space topic will be provided closer to the event.
