          <p>Auth0 by Okta makes it easy for Python developers to manage user identity and authorization in Python or your favorite Python framework. Our Developer Center provides access to SDKs, sample code, and the resources you need to build a scalable custom login experience quickly and securely, and stay focused on the app you're building.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.python.org/psf/">https://www.python.org/psf/</a></p>
          <p>The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers. The majority of the PSF's work is focused on empowering and supporting people within the Python community. The PSF has active grant programs that support sprints, conferences, meet ups, user groups, and Python development efforts all over the world. In addition, the PSF underwrites and runs PyCon US, the primary Python community conference. Being part of the PSF means being part of the Python community. Recently we changed the PSF to an open membership organization, so that everyone who uses and supports Python can join. To learn more, visit https://www.python.org/psf/membership.</p>
