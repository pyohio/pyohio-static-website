description: '<p>Cloud-native application security involves balancing contradictory
  requirements: the benefits of cloud services in accelerating development, while
  at the same time handling security in an adverse environment where there are more
  attack surfaces and opportunities for data breaches. Unfortunately, many security
  tools do not address the vulnerabilities of APIs that run in those containers. Cloud-native
  applications expose many internal API services and developers are increasingly using
  external API services for their applications. Both internal and external API use
  expose the workload to new vulnerabilities; more strongly, workload security and
  API security are really two sides to the same coin.</p>

  <p>This talk specifically focuses on the security problems and vulnerabilities exposed
  through APIs, and introduces Cisco’s Panoptica, a tool for discovering, managing,
  and repairing these vulnerabilities, and APIClarity, Panoptica’s open source core.</p>'
