description: '<p>Jupyter notebooks is one of the most powerful tools for any data
  scientist. It makes doing tasks like data wrangling, modeling, visualizing really
  quick and easy for even people with not a lot of experience in software engineering.</p>

  <p>But, a problem arises that to actually put that code into production involves
  a lot of copying, pasting, and refactoring into order to be used in a full fledged
  system. But what if we didn''t have to leave the notebook? What if the notebook
  could be the production ready code?</p>

  <p>This talk will giving an introduction to using the papermill library, how it
  works, why it''s powerful, and an actual use case of how I use papermill in a pipeline
  that transforms raw data into clean tidy data, and then runs multiple many notebooks
  to generate various visualizations and statistics to be later used in a study.</p>'
