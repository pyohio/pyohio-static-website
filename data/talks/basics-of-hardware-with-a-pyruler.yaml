description: '<p>Learn how hardware works without having to learn C. Explore basic
  embedded hardware concepts with me as we use CircuitPython and a PyRuler. CircuitPython
  is a programming language that simplifies writing code for microcontrollers. The
  PyRuler is an engineering reference for sizes of various electronic components,
  but it''s also a microcontroller board complete with LEDs, capactive touch buttons,
  and various inputs and outputs that let you get started designing your embedded
  system with little to no hardware experience.</p>
