description: '<p>Every year thousands of developers try to solve the programming puzzles
  of the Advent of Code[^1] challenge. For many Pythonistas, their favorite tool to
  do that is the Jupyter notebook. As the problems get progressively more challenging,
  solving them step-by-step is an excellent approach. You read some data, play with
  it, solve the small-scale problem and then try to solve the whole challenge.</p>

  <p>Apart from showing the output of each intermediate step, Jupyter notebooks offer
  plenty of useful features. Including:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Easy access to the documentation</li>

  <li>Different debugging mechanisms</li>

  <li>Lightweight storage</li>

  <li>Shell commands</li>

  <li>Pastebin support</li>

  </ul>

  <p>In this lightning talk, I will show you how to use them when solving problems
  in Jupyter Notebooks.</p>

  <p>[^1]: If you never heard about the Advent of Code - it''s a series of 25 code
  challenges. Each of them is released daily between the 1st and 25th of December.
  It''s like the advent calendar (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar),
  but instead of chocolate or a small gift, you get frustration if you can''t solve
  a given problem. At least I do ;)</p>'
