description: "md//Every year thousands of developers try to solve the programming\
  \ puzzles of the Advent of Code[^1] challenge. For many Pythonistas, their favorite\
  \ tool to do that is the Jupyter notebook. As the problems get progressively more\
  \ challenging, solving them step-by-step is an excellent approach. You read some\
  \ data, play with it, solve the small-scale problem and then try to solve the whole\
  \ challenge.\r\n\r\nApart from showing the output of each intermediate step, Jupyter\
  \ notebooks offer plenty of useful features. Including:\r\n\r\n* Easy access to\
  \ the documentation\r\n* Different debugging mechanisms\r\n* Lightweight storage\r\
  \n* Shell commands\r\n* Pastebin support\r\n\r\nIn this lightning talk, I will show\
  \ you how to use them when solving problems in Jupyter Notebooks.\r\n\r\n[^1]: If\
  \ you never heard about the Advent of Code - it's a series of 25 code challenges.\
  \ Each of them is released daily between the 1st and 25th of December. It's like\
  \ the advent calendar (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar), but instead\
  \ of chocolate or a small gift, you get frustration if you can't solve a given problem.\
  \ At least I do ;)"
