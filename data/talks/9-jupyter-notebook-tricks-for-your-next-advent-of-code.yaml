  challenge. For many Pythonistas, their favorite tool to do that is the Jupyter notebook.
  As the problems get progressively more challenging, solving them step-by-step is
  an excellent approach. You read some data, play with it, solve the small-scale problem
  and then try to solve the whole challenge.</p>

  <p>Apart from showing the output of each intermediate step, Jupyter notebooks offer
  plenty of useful features. Including:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Easy access to the documentation</li>

  <li>Different debugging mechanisms</li>

  <li>Lightweight storage</li>

  <li>Shell commands</li>

  <li>Pastebin support</li>

  </ul>

  <p>In this lightning talk, I will show you how to use them when solving problems
  in Jupyter Notebooks.</p>

  <p>If you never heard about the Advent of Code - it''s a series of 25 code challenges.
  Each of them is released daily between the 1st and 25th of December. It''s like
  the advent calendar (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar</a>),
  but instead of chocolate or a small gift, you get frustration if you can''t solve
  a given problem. At least I do ;)&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1"
