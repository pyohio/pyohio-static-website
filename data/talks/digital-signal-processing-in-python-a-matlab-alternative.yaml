description: <p>I will be discussing the use of digital signal processing techniques
  using various Python libraries, such as numpy and scipy, as alternatives to classic
  signal engineering approaches in MATLAB. An introductory walk-through example will
  be given, as well commentary on how to pipeline processed signal into machine learning
  libraries such as scikit-learn and tensorflow2.</p>
