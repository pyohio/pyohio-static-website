description: '<p>Cloud-native application security involves balancing contradictory
  requirements: the benefits of cloud services in accelerating development, while
  at the same time handling security in an adverse environment where there are more
  attack surfaces and opportunities for data breaches. Today, tools exist that focus
  specifically on the security and vulnerability posture of cloud workloads. Container
  and configuration vulnerabilities are identified, and enforcement policies are enacted
  to protect the workloads if these are operating with such vulnerabilities.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, many security tools do not address the vulnerabilities of APIs.
  Cloud-native applications expose many internal API services and developers are increasingly
  using external API services for their applications. Both internal and external API
  use expose the workload to new vulnerabilities; more strongly, workload security
  and API security are really two sides to the same coin. This talk specifically focuses
  on the security problems and vulnerabilities exposed through APIs.</p>

  <p>Questions we address include:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>What does a developer know about a service before using it?</li>

  <li>Does a poorly defined interface expose API service vulnerabilities?</li>

  <li>Does the service perform well to begin with?</li>

  <li>How does the developer get/maintain an access token?</li>

  <li>Do API specs show critical use cases and dependencies?</li>

  <li>Can the security impact of an external API service be estimated and managed?</li>

  <li>Do the APIs violate the OWASP API top 10?</li>

  <li>How can we test against the OWASP API top 10?</li>

  <li>Can PII be shared with such services?</li>

  </ul>

  <p>We show how SecureCN addresses both sides of the security coin: container workload
  and API security in one tool, and we present actual issues with a live demonstration
  of SecureCN.</p>'
