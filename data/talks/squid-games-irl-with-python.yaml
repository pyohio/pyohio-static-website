description: '<p>During this pandemic, we have all spent way too much time watching
  TV shows and we all are going a little crazy... Have you ever thought about building
  something in real life from your favorite TV show? Josh has not either... Oh wait!
  He has!</p>

  <p>After binge watching “Squid Games” a little too quickly and access to too much
  manufacturing equipment such as laser cutters and 3D printers. He decides to ride
  the trend and make a gun to play Red Light Green Light from the first game of “Squid
  Games” in real life. Sounds scary, am I right?... Do not worry... it is not lethal...
  yet... Mahah...</p>

  <p>In this talk you will learn how to come up with ideas for your projects. How
  to source parts and a (nerf) gun for your next project with little hardware hacking
  and controlling that hardware in python. Learn how to design models in Fusion 360
  and create rapid prototypes with a 3D printer. Lastly, create basic AI with OpenCV.</p>'
