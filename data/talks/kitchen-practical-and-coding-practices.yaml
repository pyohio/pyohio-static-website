description: <p>A whirlwind tour of the evolution of kitchens from Victorian caverns
  to domestic economy, and what that transition can teach us about the very real value
  of code ergonomics. This talk is based on Lillian Gilbreth's domestic research and
  revolutions, and applies to the very screen you are looking at right now. Come for
  the iceboxes, apply science to your IDEs.</p>
