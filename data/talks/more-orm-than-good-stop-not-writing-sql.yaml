description: '<p>You''ve spent too much time learning tool after tool to avoid writing
  SQL, when there''s a really good way to interact with databases; it''s called SQL.  Just
  use it!  But not alone; there''s a class of simple tools that help you keep your
  SQL well-organized and tie it cleanly into your Python code:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>For database migrations, Agnostic</li>

  <li>Instead of an ORM, PugSQL</li>

  <li>... or a query builder like PyPika</li>

  <li>For ETL transformations, dbt</li>

  </ul>'
