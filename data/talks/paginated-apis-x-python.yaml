description: '<p>While working with making requests to external RESTful APIs using
  Python, we can use just one line to get data. What if the endpoints are paginated
  and have limitations as well? Developers may find it hard to code for paginated
  results, store them and/or add throttling between consecutive requests. </p>

  <p>This talk will cover some useful and robust ways to deal efficiently with range
  paginated APIs patterns using Python.</p>
