  \ you want to release it to the world, you want to make sure it follows the Python\
  \ coding standards.\r\n\r\nYou have heard of Flake8, but you are unsure whether\
  \ you should install it system-wide, run it in your IDE or in even in CI?\r\n\r\n\
  How and where should you configure Flake8?\r\n\r\nHow do you make sure your colleagues\
  \ also use the same linters... in the same version?"
