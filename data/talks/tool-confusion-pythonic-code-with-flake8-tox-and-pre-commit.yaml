  <p>But before you want to release it to the world, you want to make sure it follows
  the Python coding standards.</p>

  run it in your IDE or in even in CI?</p>

  <p>How and where should you configure Flake8?</p>

  <p>How do you make sure your colleagues also use the same linters... in the same
  version?</p>'
