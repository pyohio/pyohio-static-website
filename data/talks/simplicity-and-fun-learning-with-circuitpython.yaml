description: '<p><a href="https://circuitpython.org">CircuitPython</a> is an open
  source version of Python, designed to run on tiny computers called microcontrollers.
  It has, from the start, focused on being beginner friendly and lowering the barrier
  to entry for new folks into programming and electronics. This focus has led to creating
  a language that is considered, by educators, to be an excellent option for teaching
  in various environments, including university and high school classes, code camps,
  and more. CircuitPython has accomplished this in multiple ways, including: easy
  access to <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/category/circuitpython">thorough documentation</a>,
  building a welcoming and supportive <a href="https://adafru.it/discord">community</a>,
  extensive <a href="https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/bundle/en/latest/drivers.html">hardware
  support</a>, making it simple to <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython">get
  started</a>, and, most importantly, making learning fun! Discover how and why CircuitPython
  is a great choice for education.</p>'
