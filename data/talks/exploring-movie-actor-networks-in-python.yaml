description: <p>This talk explores popular network clustering algorithms (using the
  scikit-network and networkx Python libraries) on real-world movie datasets -- and
  shows how to find the path between two actors (via costars), how Iranian and Turkish
  actors are far removed from Hollywood but close to each other, and the one major
  film industry that is far away from the rest of the world.</p>
