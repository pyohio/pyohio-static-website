description: <p>In this short talk we'll explore what a sample usage of the Azure
  ML Python SDK looks like and how you can use Python and Azure Machine Learning Studio
  to track and version datasets and machine learning models, discover new models that
  perform well with your data, evaluate those models, and deploy them as a web service
  - all without having to leave your IDE.</p>
