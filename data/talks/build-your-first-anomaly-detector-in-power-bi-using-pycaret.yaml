description: <p>Combining machine learning with business intelligence can have a significant
  impact on the insights a business derives from its data. PyCaret is a low-code,
  open-source machine learning library for Python, and PyCaret can be integrated within
  Microsoft Power BI. This empowers citizen data analysts and data scientists to add
  machine learning to their dashboards and reports within minutes. In this demonstration,
  I'll give an overview of PyCaret and outline the different ways it can be used to
  enrich your Power BI reports and dashboards. I'll detail the necessary set-up steps
  to start using PyCaretâ€™s machine learning capabilities in Power BI. Finally, I'll
  demonstrate how to train and implement an unsupervised anomaly detector in Power
  BI using PyCaret.</p>
