description: '<p>FastAPI is a high-performing web framework used to build APIs in
  Python3. It''s <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/"><em>really</em> fast</a>
  and based on the OpenAPI standard, which means - tada! No more manual swagger generation
  and validation! </p>

  <p>In this talk, we''ll go over some code snippets that involve:<br />

  - creating simple endpoints with path and query parameters<br />

  - creating response body models based on Pydantic <br />

  - logging<br />

  - handling simple errors<br />

  - generated swagger</p>'
