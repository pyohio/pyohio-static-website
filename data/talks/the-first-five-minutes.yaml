description: <p>A person's first experience with your project is critical. It doesn't
  matter how smoothly things go afterwards, if they run into a roadblock towards the
  beginning, it alters their perception moving forward. You must create a positive
  experience for folks, or they may choose to move on to something else. The CircuitPython
  project strives to create that initial positive experience. This talk will show
  what that experience looks like, and then discuss what you can do to apply the same
  concepts to your project. How will you shape the First Five Minutes?</p>
