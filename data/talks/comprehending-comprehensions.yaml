description: '<p>In this short talk, I will introduce all the key ideas necessary
  for you to finally understand comprehensions: list, dict, and set comprehensions,
  plus generator expressions.</p>

  <p>I will explain the <strong>key</strong> argument in favour of list comprehensions
  and I will show how to turn any suitable loop into its equivalent comprehension.</p>

  <p>By the time the talk is over, you''ll be much closer to getting your black belt
  in comprehension-fu.</p>

  <p><strong>References</strong>: you <a href="https://gum.co/comprehending-comprehensions">can
  get the ebook “Comprehending Comprehensions”</a> and you can find the talk slides
