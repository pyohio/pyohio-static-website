description: md//Is your python scripts taking too long, and your CPU utilization
  too low? Enter the concurrent execution standard libraries (`threading`, `multiprocessing`,
  `concurrent.futures`, etc.). Throughout the talk, we will look through various toy
  problems and learn how we can quickly speed it up for IO bound and CPU bound processes
  using the python standard library.  So you can get more done and raise that CPU
  usage to 100%.
