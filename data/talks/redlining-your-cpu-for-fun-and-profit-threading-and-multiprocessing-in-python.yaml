description: <p>Is your Python script taking too long, and your CPU utilization too
  low? Enter the concurrent execution standard libraries (<code>threading</code>,
  <code>multiprocessing</code>, <code>concurrent.futures</code>, etc.). Throughout
  the talk, we will look through various toy problems and learn how we can quickly
  speed it up for IO bound and CPU bound processes using the Python standard library,
  so you can get more done and raise that CPU usage to 100%.</p>
