description: '<p><strong>Your Python Multi-tool</strong>: <em>Four built-ins and a
  module</em> </p>

  <p>There are four built-in functions and a module that makeup a "Python Multi-tool".</p>

  <p>help, dir, type, id, and inspect </p>

  <p>Whether you are new to Python or have years of experience, these five tools are
  very helpful when learning something new in the language. Easy to use and often
  overlooked for use by tutorials, these are powerful allies that will be (re)introduced
  to you in this talk.</p>'
