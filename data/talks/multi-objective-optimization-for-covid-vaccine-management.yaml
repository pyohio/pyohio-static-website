description: '<p>In the past several months, we have seen that effectively distributing
  COVID-19 vaccinations is an incredibly important and daunting task. Due to a wide
  and asymmetric imbalance between supply and demand, finding the right balance, timing,
  and utilization of vaccinations has proven difficult for everyone involved. Organizations
  need to correctly predict demand at different times at specific locations to minimize
  spoilage and optimize utilization rate while accounting for limited supply.</p>

  <p>In this talk, Samira Soleimani, Data Scientist at Sense Corp, will demonstrate
  how machine learning algorithm and multi-objective optimization can be used to help
  tackle this challenge. First, Samira will show several techniques for demand forecasting
  using and comparing several machine learning algorithms. Second, she will introduce
  and compare line and curve-fitting approaches to define objective functions for
  distribution optimization. Then, she will explain and implement multi-objective
  particle swarm optimization (PSO) in the python package “PyGMO” to find the optimal
  point for vaccine distribution in a neighborhood.</p>'
