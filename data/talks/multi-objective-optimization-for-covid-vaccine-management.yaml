description: '<p>In the past several months, we have seen that effectively distributing
  COVID-19 vaccinations is an incredibly important and daunting task. Due to a wide
  and asymmetric imbalance between supply and demand, finding the right balance, timing,
  and utilization of vaccinations has proven difficult for everyone involved. Organizations
  need to correctly predict demand at different times at specific locations to minimize
  spoilage and optimize utilization rate while accounting for limited supply.<br />

  In this talk, Samira Soleimani, Data Scientist at CGI, will demonstrate how machine
  learning algorithm and multi-objective optimization can be used to help tackle this
  challenge. First, Samira will explain the difference between single-objective and
  multi-objective optimizations. Second, she will introduce and compare line and curve-fitting
  approaches to define objective functions for distribution optimization. Then, she
  will explain and implement multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) in
  the python package “PyGMO” to find the optimal point for vaccine distribution in
  a neighborhood.</p>'
