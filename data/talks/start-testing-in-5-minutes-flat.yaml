description: '<p>Every software project should have some degree of testing. Why? No
  code is perfect, and bugs happen! Unfortunately, many people don''t write tests
  because they feel like it''s too much work, or they don''t know how to start.</p>

  <p>In this lightning talk, I''ll show you how to start testing your code using <code>pytest</code>.
  We will cover how to configure <code>pytest</code>, where to put tests, and how
  to write concise yet meaningful tests. Slides will include example code with full
  test cases. I''ll also share resources for learning more advanced techniques. In
  5 minutes flat, you''ll see just how easy it is to add valuable tests to your Python
  projects!</p>'
