description: "md//Every software project should have some degree of testing. Why?\
  \ No code is perfect, and bugs happen! Unfortunately, many people don't write tests\
  \ because they feel like it's too much work, or they don't know how to start.\r\n\
  \r\nIn this lightning talk, I'll show you how to start testing your code using `pytest`.\
  \ We will cover how to configure `pytest`, where to put tests, and how to write\
  \ concise yet meaningful tests. Slides will include example code with full test\
  \ cases. I'll also share resources for learning more advanced techniques. In 5 minutes\
  \ flat, you'll see just how easy it is to add valuable tests to your Python projects!"
