description: <p>This talk will highlight a problem such as classification of speech
  data where the expected spoken utterance is a location name, and how one can have
  a machine learn differences between utterances. Speech feature extraction and building
  a successful classification model will be discussed using open-source tools in Python,
  along with practical examples to demonstrate usage using pyAudioProcessing. <a href="https://github.com/jsingh811/pyAudioProcessing">https://github.com/jsingh811/pyAudioProcessing</a></p>
