description: <p>Ever found yourself stuck in a SSH session with some Python code that
  isn't behaving and the need to debug the code? Or are you just someone who prefers
  using vim and tmux like myself? What if there was a way to debug your code in an
  interface that doesn't require a huge IDE in order to run? This talk will guide
  you through using vim, tmux, and pudb to effectively debug code in various situations.
  We'll show how to insert breakpoints into the code and do remote debugging, all
  from the comfort of a tmux shell.</p>
