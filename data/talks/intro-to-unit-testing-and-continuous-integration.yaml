description: '<p>Having unit tests and continuous integration (CI) as part of your
  development are considered best practises. But how do these things work? In this
  talk, we will cover the benefits of writing unit tests and how to get started with
  it in Python. Then, we''ll step it up running tests as part CI. And that''s not
  all! CI is not just about running tests, but for other things as well, like code
  quality checks, and even building and generating documentation.</p>
