description: '<p>Exception handling in Python is flexible and efficient, leading to
  EAFP ("easier to ask for forgiveness than permission") becoming an idiomatic way
  to write Python code. Exception groups dramatically extend the scope of what''s
  possible with exceptions in Python.</p>

  <p>Exception Groups are a new feature proposed in PEP 654 and to be released in
  Python 3.11. They will make it possible to</p>

  <ul>

  <li>simultaneously raise multiple unrelated exceptions in a group and</li>

  <li>filter exceptions from groups using the new <code>exception*</code> syntax.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>This feels a little like a complicated solution looking for a suitable problem.
  In this talk I''ll argue for the utility of this new feature and show some examples
  of where it will prove to be a very useful addition to the language.</p>'
