  \n\r\nAbstract\r\nEveryone knows that writing code making art is easy! There are\
  \ so many free resources available on the internet that becoming a programmer an\
  \ artist has never been easier! In this talk I’ll demo several ways to make a todo\
  \ list draw a circle! We’ll go through a variety of mediums to get you up-to-speed\
  \ with new languages and frameworks mediums and methods in no time like:\r\n\r\n\
  Types of paper and surfaces\r\nOverview of mediums (graphite, inks, acrylics, oils,\
  \ and more!)\r\nPerformance Art (Dance, Theater, and Song!)\r\nDigital Applications\
  \ with live demo circles including:\r\nInkscape\r\nGnu Image Manipulation Program\r\
  \nBlender\r\np5.js\r\nKrita\r\nHTML & CSS\r\nand whatever came out between this\
  \ blurb and the event!\r\nBy the end of this talk you’ll be more confident than\
  \ ever (and not at all overwhelmed!) by the prospect of how easy it is to become\
  \ a programmer an artist in 2021!\r\n\r\nTimeline\r\n(1-2 Minute mark): The first\
  \ 1-2 minutes will be spent parodying the language/syntax/and visual style of several\
  \ landing pages/blogs/paid courses etc. of non-free and free “learn to code” resources.\
  \ This should be light and funny – the parody will be obvious – but we’re going\
  \ to take this more seriously than mere parody (i.e. how hard can it be to draw\
  \ a circle? We’ll take this seriously, though still in a playful/in-character way.)\r\
  \n(3-7 Minute mark): The bulk of the presentation will literally be demonstrating\
  \ a multitude of ways to “simply” draw a circle.\r\nI will actually have relevant\
  \ asides about perfect circles (using a drafting compass) vs. sufficient circles\
  \ (freehand strategies)\r\nWe’ll talk about these strategies in a variety of mediums\
  \ (pen, paper, ink, etc.)\r\nWe’ll discuss the actual effect that different physical\
  \ papers may have on the resulting shape (printer paper, canvas, etc.).\r\nI’ll\
  \ live demo the creation of a “simple” circle in a variety of free-software tools\
  \ including Inkscape, Gimp, Krita, and Blender (and more as in the abstract). I\
  \ will note that I will not be showing how to install these applications on your\
  \ machines.\r\nI’ll also discuss how to make these actually perfect circles created\
  \ by software less perfect for artistic reasons (and show how to do that in each\
  \ application).\r\n(8-9 Minute mark): I’ll conclude with the same platitudes about\
  \ how drawing a circle is easy and how the learning resources available to you today\
  \ pale in comparison to what I had when I was learning to draw a circle decades\
  \ ago.\r\n(9-10 Minute mark): Break the fourth wall / drop character: I have a PhD\
  \ in Fine Arts and I’m working on learning coding. I’ll close by noting that coding\
  \ (like drawing a circle) can both be “easy” and “hopelessly confusing” based on\
  \ previous knowledge and experience, and it’s important to regularly remind ourselves\
  \ of this fact when working with, encouraging, and speaking to others. I hope this\
  \ will help everyone consider this more strongly moving forward.\r\nIntended audience\r\
  \nLearning to Code: If someone is learning to code (i.e. starting out) they’ve likely\
  \ come across enough material to both understand and be painfully aware of the parody\
  \ I’m doing and recognize the specific challenge can exist outside of the tech space\
  \ too.\r\nActively Coding / Coding Mentors / Tech Bloggers, etc.: This group will,\
  \ I hope, laugh at the title, laugh at the intro, and in the middle demo section\
  \ realize that what they thought was easy (drawing a circle) has much more complexity\
  \ too it then they thought, and have the parody hit home in a different way that\
  \ changes their approach to new learners (and also themselves as tech is always\
  \ changing).\r\nOthers: I think this is a balanced talk for everyone of all knowledge\
  \ levels. At absolute worst, people will have a primer on how to draw a circle in\
  \ a multitude of ways. That’s a pretty good worst outcome."
