description: <p>Flappy Bird is one of the most popular mobile games in the world.
  The game consists of a bird that can flap up and down as it navigates through the
  gaps in many pipes to receive a higher score.Through my adventures with python and
  AI, I have been learning about genetic algorithms and how they work. I used the
  flappy bird to expand my knowledge of theory and applications of genetic algorithms,
  neural networks, and much more. Let me take you on my journey of creating an AI
  to play Flappy Bird!</p>
