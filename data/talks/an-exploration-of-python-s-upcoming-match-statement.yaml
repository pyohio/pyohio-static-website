description: '<p>The match statement is a new feature of the Python language, defined
  in PEP-634 and will be standard in the upcoming Python 3.10 (due out in October
  2021).</p>

  <p>Adding syntax for new language features introduces both new possibilities and
  sources for confusion. Let''s stay ahead of the game by learning what to expect
  from the match statement by playing with the alpha version of Python (available
  now).</p>

  <p>This talk will compare the match statement to similar constructs in other languages,
  demonstrate some typical use cases, briefly discuss Python''s implementation, and
  propose some best practices when solving problems with the match statement.</p>'
