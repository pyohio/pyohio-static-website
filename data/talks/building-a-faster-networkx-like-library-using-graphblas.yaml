description: '<p>This is a call for engagement to help with <a href="https://github.com/python-graphblas/graphblas-algorithms"><code>graphblas-algorithms</code></a>!<br
  />

  We''ll also have weird math and weird Python syntax,<br />

  so you can also come for the fun of getting your mind blown :)</p>

  <p>GraphBLAS is a mathematical abstraction layer designed to express many<br />

  graph algorithms in the language of linear algebra.  It''s weird and written in
  C.<br />

  It is also <em>incredibly</em> fast and powerful.<br />

  Graph analytics has applications across industries and sciences--more than you might
  expect--and we want to get the power of GraphBLAS into the hands of Pythonistas
  and practitioners.</p>

  <p>Our package, <a href="https://github.com/python-graphblas/python-graphblas"><code>python-graphblas</code></a>,
  allows us to write GraphBLAS in the style of math, not the C API.<br />

  Counterintuitively, by introducing some unconventional notation, we were able to
  make our library more Pythonic.<br />

  However, <a href="https://github.com/python-graphblas/python-graphblas"><code>python-graphblas</code></a>
  is still low-level, and most users probably won''t use it directly.<br />

  Instead, most people will probably want to use <a href="https://github.com/python-graphblas/graphblas-algorithms"><code>graphblas-algorithms</code></a>,<br
  />

  a library that looks like <a href="https://networkx.org/">NetworkX</a>, the most
  popular graph library in Python.</p>

  <p><a href="https://github.com/python-graphblas/graphblas-algorithms"><code>graphblas-algorithms</code></a>
  is young.<br />

  It is growing and has great potential, but it could use more help.<br />

  Who can help?  Anybody who is interested!  We have a well-defined target--the <a
  href="https://networkx.org/">NetworkX</a> API and its tests--so<br />

  it''s very easy to find things to do.<br />

  We actually find it fun like solving puzzles, and there is still a lot of low-lying
  fruit.<br />

  If you don''t know much about graphs or how to contribute to open-source, this could
  be a great way to learn!</p>'
