description: <p>Getting productive with a Python codebase, especially when you're
  unfamiliar with the ecosystem, can be daunting. Building a cohesive strategy with
  widely-available tooling shortens the time-to-productivity for new contributors
  to projects internal and open-source, demonstrating that the maintainers care about
  onboarding and the developer experience. I'll give an introduction to how my team
  solved this problem using a 46-year-old program and push the audience in a direction
  toward better developer experiences starting at the greatest common denominator
  of tooling.</p>
