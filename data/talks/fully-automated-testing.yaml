description: '<p>I maintain Hypothesis, a library to automatically generate inputs
  to your tests (like "a list of integers" or "an object matching this database schema")
  -- so you don''t have to think of all the edge-cases yourself.  But we can go further!  Hypothesis
  now ships with a "Ghostwriter" which can write tests for you, based on the function
  and argument names you choose (and docstrings and type annotations, if you use those).</p>

  <p>If you''re tired of testing but still don''t want bugs, come see how we can take
  automation to a whole new level :-)</p>'
