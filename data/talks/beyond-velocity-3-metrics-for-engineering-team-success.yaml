description: '<p>Velocity is an important metric to a lot of software teams, but in
  my experience, it’s often been the most important metric to management — often at
  the expense of missing out on the rest of the story. In this talk, we''ll explore
  Earned Business Value, Lead Time, and Cumulative Flow to examine how these metrics
  might deliver additional insight into teams'' development lifecycles.</p>

  <p>If you''d like to learn more about software metrics, I recommend these two books:</p>

  <ul>

  <li><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/software-development-metrics">Software
  Development Metrics</a> by David Nicolette</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/agile-metrics-in-action">Agile Metrics
  in Action</a> by Christopher Davis</li>
