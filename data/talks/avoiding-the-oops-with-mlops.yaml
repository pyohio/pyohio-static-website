description: <p>Machine Learning (ML) projects are gaining ground in industry, yet
  87% never pass the experiment phase. So often we pour endless time and money building
  models to help us make predictions about the world, but even top performing models
  cannot deliver on their intended purpose if they are not able to efficiently run
  in their intended environment. Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) strives for automation
  and monitoring at all steps of ML system development and construction so projects
  have a greater chance of becoming operationalized. With MLOps we have the opportunity
  to apply traditional DevOps principles that have transformed the world of software
  delivery, like unification of system development and operations, to machine learning.
  This talk will cover the principles of MLOps and outline the path to making ML in
  production a reality.</p>
