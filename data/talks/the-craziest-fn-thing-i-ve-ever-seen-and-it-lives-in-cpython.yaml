description: '<p>I am enamored with dataclasses. I love them in Python, I love them
  in Kotlin. A while back I was looking for a Kotlin dataclass feature in Python,
  and was disappointed to find it wasn''t there. I went digging into the CPython source
  code to see if it could be added and found the craziest function I''d ever seen,
  _create_fn, and it''s used everywhere in the dataclass implementation!</p>

  <p>Join me as I shared what I found out about my dear dataclasses, and get a better
  understand of decorators and metaprogramming in Python!</p>'
