description: '<p>From Data Science and Machine Learning to Software Engineering and
  testing, access to accurate data is one of the biggest bottlenecks hindering development.
  Developers need accurate, relevant data to safely experiment when building applications,
  machine learning models, testing, etc. However, developers often run into issues
  gathering data, from a lack of data to the inability to access the data due to privacy
  policies. But what if you could have instant access to an unlimited supply of high-fidelity
  data that’s statistically accurate, privacy-protected, and safe to share? This is
  where Synthetic Data comes in. In this talk, you''ll learn about Synthetic Data,
  the problems it solves, and how to get started generating as much relevant data
  as you want.</p>

  <p>In this talk, we''ll discuss what Synthetic Data is, the benefits of using Synthetic
  Data, and the efficacy of it. You''ll see real-world situations where Synthetic
  Data removes bias, augments data sets, and makes once private data easily shareable
  while still protecting the privacy of the initial data set.</p>'
