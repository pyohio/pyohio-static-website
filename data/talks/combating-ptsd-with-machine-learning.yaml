description: '<p>The United States is facing an urgent crisis in the treatment of
  its military veterans. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious health
  issue assailing our veteran population. There are currently 300,000+ disability
  claims and appeals pending in the Board of Veteran Affairsâ€™ (BVA) of the U.S. Department
  of Veterans Affairs.  PTSD claims makeup at least 22% of that total. Presently,
  the timeline from claim to appeal exceeds 4 years. This logjam in the VA claims
  and appeals can be mitigated by automating this process using machine learning techniques.
  </p>

  <p>All PTSD claims are legal arguments. As such, all legal arguments must have structured
  reasoning. Using this legal structure, documents can be processed by Python NLP
  machine learning models. These models can be used to streamline the process of adjudicating
  the claims and appeals. </p>
