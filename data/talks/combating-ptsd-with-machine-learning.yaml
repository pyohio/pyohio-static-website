description: "md//The United States is facing an urgent crisis in the treatment of\
  \ its military veterans. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious health\
  \ issue assailing our veteran population. There are currently 300,000+ disability\
  \ claims and appeals pending in the Board of Veteran Affairs’ (BVA) of the U.S.\
  \ Department of Veterans Affairs.  PTSD claims makeup at least 22% of that total.\
  \ Presently, the timeline from claim to appeal exceeds 4 years. This logjam in the\
  \ VA claims and appeals can be mitigated by automating this process using machine\
  \ learning techniques. \r\n\r\nAll PTSD claims are legal arguments. As such, all\
  \ legal arguments must have structured reasoning. Using this legal structure, documents\
  \ can be processed by Python NLP machine learning models. These models can be used\
  \ to streamline the process of adjudicating the claims and appeals."
