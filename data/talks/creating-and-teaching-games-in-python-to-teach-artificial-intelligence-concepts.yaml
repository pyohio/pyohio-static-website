description: "md//I am a High School Freshman who enjoys coding and robotics. For\
  \ the past 3 years, I have taken Artificial Intelligence classes as a student. AI\
  \ is a buzz word - It is an exciting yet daunting subject. My instructor made these\
  \ classes fun and less daunting by using real world examples and games. I got so\
  \ inspired, I started understanding and writing neural networks in Python in no\
  \ time. Now, I am trying to create the same experience for my students.\r\n\r\n\
  I am a volunteer teacher at https://www.corp.aiclub.world/ where I teach AI concepts\
  \ to students in 6th - 12th grade. When I create a course, I think of how to include\
  \ AI concepts in games. I write games utilizing libraries like turtle and pygame.\
  \ I consult with my instructor and they help review my courses.\r\n\r\nI would like\
  \ to share my approach , give the audiences a sneak peak at my curriculum and share\
  \ some resources that I have created. \r\n\r\nHere are some examples of my curriculum:\r\
