description: '<p>I am a High School Freshman who enjoys coding and robotics. For the
  past 3 years, I have taken Artificial Intelligence classes as a student. AI is a
  buzz word - It is an exciting yet daunting subject. My instructor made these classes
  fun and less daunting by using real world examples and games. I got so inspired,
  I started understanding and writing neural networks in Python in no time. Now, I
  am trying to create the same experience for my students.</p>

  <p>I am a volunteer teacher at <a href="https://www.corp.aiclub.world/">https://www.corp.aiclub.world/</a>
  where I teach AI concepts to students in 6th - 12th grade. When I create a course,
  I think of how to include AI concepts in games. I write games utilizing libraries
  like turtle and pygame. I consult with my instructor and they help review my courses.</p>

  <p>I would like to share my approach, give the audiences a sneak peak at my curriculum,
  and share some resources that I have created. </p>

  <p>Here are some examples of my curriculum:</p>
