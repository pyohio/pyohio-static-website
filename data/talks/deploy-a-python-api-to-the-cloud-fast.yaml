description: <p>APIs are great and fun to develop, but how can you deploy and host
  one? This talk will cover designing and deploying a simple Python REST API to AWS
  using AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway, using the AWS Serverless Application Model
  as infrastructure as code to define the API specs and deploy all of the code. All
  with ZERO server interactions!</p>
