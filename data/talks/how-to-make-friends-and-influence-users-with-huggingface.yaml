description: <p>This will be a tutorial based talk with a demo at the end on how to
  use conversational language models and sentiment analysis models to make an interactive
  chatbot. The models that we will use are Blenderbot from Facebook Research and distilbert
  from google research / huggingface. We will also use Transformers from Huggingface
  which is an easy to use packaging and API for the above systems and also go over
  using speech recognition and text to speech to make interaction more fluid. At the
  end there will be an interactive demo.</p>
