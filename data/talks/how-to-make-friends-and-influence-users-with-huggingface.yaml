description: md//This will be a tutorial based talk with a demo at the end on how
  to use conversational language models and sentiment analysis models to make an interactive
  chatbot. The models that we will use are Blenderbot from Facebook Research and Bert
  from google research. We will also use Transformers from Huggingface which is an
  easy to use packaging and API for the above systems and also go over using speech
  recognition and text to speech to make interaction more fluid. At the end there
  will be an interactive demo.
