description: '<p>If you want to write expressive and accessible Python for the people
  you collaborate with, Python Types should definitely be in your arsenal. There has
  been a significant evolution to Pythonâ€™s support for types: Newer, more elegant
  syntax is available to help your code better communicate what its doing, and what
  your functions are returning. There has never been a better time to try out typing,
  or take a deeper look at newly available patterns.</p>'
