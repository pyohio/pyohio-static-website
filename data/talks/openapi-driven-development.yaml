description: '<p>As a service owner, one needs to provide strong guarantees for the
  behavior of their APIs. To avoid eroding developer trust in your service, we show
  how we guarantee strong contracts using <a href="https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0">OpenAPI</a>
  while avoiding extraneous overhead for service owners. This talk shows how to autogenerate
  OpenAPI schemas, prevent breaking changes automatically with your CI/CD, and how
  we improved the delivery cycle time for our teams.</p>

  <p>At <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, we connect over 5,000 of your favorite
  online apps together. We''ve learned how to produce high-quality APIs with over
  10 years of experience integrating with APIs. We''re applying these best practices
  as we break out our services from our Django monolith.</p>'
