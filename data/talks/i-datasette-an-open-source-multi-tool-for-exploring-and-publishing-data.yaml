description: "md//Datasette is described by its creator, Simon Willison, as \"a tool\
  \ for exploring and publishing data\", and it provides an amazing data presentation,\
  \ exploration, and retrieval platform that can rapidly be deployed to local, cloud\
  \ or traditional web servers. In this Thunder Talk, I'll demonstrate a project where\
  \ I deployed an instance of Datasette at the Cincinnati & Hamilton County Public\
  \ Library to rapidly provide reports to domain experts who are focusing on item\
  \ and bibliographic record data.\r\n\r\nDatasette Project\r\n-------------------\r\
