description: '<p>Datasette is described by its creator, Simon Willison, as "a tool
  for exploring and publishing data", and it provides an amazing data presentation,
  exploration, and retrieval platform that can rapidly be deployed to local, cloud
  or traditional web servers. In this Thunder Talk, I''ll demonstrate a project where
  I deployed an instance of Datasette at the Cincinnati &amp; Hamilton County Public
  Library to rapidly provide reports to domain experts who are focusing on item and
  bibliographic record data.</p>
