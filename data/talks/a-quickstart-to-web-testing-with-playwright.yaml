description: '<p>Playwright is a fantastic new open source web testing framework from
  Microsoft. With Playwright, you can automate tests for web apps and REST APIs that
  run on multiple browsers without flaky failures. It''s a nice, modern alternative
  to Selenium WebDriver, and you can use Playwright in plain-old Python!</p>

  <p>In this concise 10-minute quickstart, we''ll learn how to configure a Python
  project with Playwright and <code>pytest</code>, automate a basic web test, and
  run it against different browsers. You''ll be able to add more tests to our starter
  project on your own after the talk!</p>
