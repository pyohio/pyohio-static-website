description: '<p>Software architecture has a bad rep. It''s supposed to be tricky,
  difficult, erudite. That''s crazy.</p>

  <p>Architecture is about writing code that is effective: it''s about finding your
  target audience, identifying what they need, and thinking about how to make it easy
  to do THAT. That''s it.</p>

  <p>This talk is about 5 basic principles for software architecture that can be applied
  to projects big and small: correctness, clarity, simplicity, modularity and empathy.
  It''s about boiling architecture down to it''s bare essence - ergonomics. We''ll
  look at these 5 principles and end up with 4 super-distilled lessons that we can
  apply TODAY to our code to make it better.</p>'
