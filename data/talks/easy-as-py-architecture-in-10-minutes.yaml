description: "md//Software architecture has a bad rep. It's supposed to be tricky,\
  \ difficult, erudite. That's crazy.\r\n\r\nArchitecture is about writing code that\
  \ is effective: it's about finding your target audience, identifying what they need,\
  \ and thinking about how to make it easy to do THAT. That's it.\r\n\r\nThis talk\
  \ is about 5 basic principles for software architecture that can be applied to projects\
  \ big and small: correctness, clarity, simplicity, modularity and empathy. It's\
  \ about boiling architecture down to it's bare essence - ergonomics. We'll look\
  \ at these 5 principles in code examples, and end up with 4 super-distilled lessons\
  \ that we can apply TODAY to our code to make it better."
