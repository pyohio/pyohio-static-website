biography: <p>I begin my career focused on accounting. First as an auditor then as
  a consultant working at public accounting firms. I had a variety of interests, which
  led me to trying out different roles within the companies that I worked at - from
  actuarial analysis of medical claims to using SQL to process accounting data and
  build reports for SEC financial statements. Currently, I work as a data engineer
  at a technology company that focuses on providing solutions to banks and other financial
  institutions.</p>
