biography: '<p>I am a data engineer helping to optimize the delivery and usage of
  data throughout our product through data engineering and automated pipelines. I
  assist in the day to day process of extracting, transforming, and loading our data
  to and from a variety of platforms and use cases. In addition to developing pipelines,
  I am also experience with oncall duties and assisting in time constrained periods
  when a bug needs to be solved on-demand.</p>

  <p>With regard to community involvement, I have volunteered throughout my career
  with grassroots Nashville initiatives. Mainly, I was the marketing chair for PyTN
  2018 bringing the Python community together and co-organizer with GirlGeekDinner
  Nashville helping to empower more women to join the Nashville Tech community by
  exploring new technologies at our technical workshops and building relationships
  of mentorship and community at our networking dinners.</p>

  <p>I graduated from Nashville Software School incorporating my knowledge of language
  and the arts with the logic of software development. I have a background in English
  Literature, Real Estate (Property Management), and marketing.</p>'
