biography: <p><a href="https://kattni.com">Kattni</a> is a maker, mentor, open source
  community leader, technical writer, and embedded software developer. She is proud
  to be a woman in tech. She began creating things at an early age in her dad’s extensive
  workshop in the basement. Kattni’s journey into the world of open source, electronics,
  and programming began in July 2017, and her desk is still a mess of wires and circuit
  boards. She is sponsored by Adafruit to work on <a href="https://circuitpython.org">the
  CircuitPython project</a>. In the rest of her life, Kattni is a maker, creator,
  programmer, photographer, one-time gardener, and loved partner. She is tolerated
  by a cat who continues to let her live with it.</p>
