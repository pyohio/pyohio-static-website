biography: <p>I started learning Python and Django in Fall 2021 with hopes that my
  colleague and I would be able to rebuild an aging internal web app. Today, that
  project is nearly complete, and my enthusiasm for Python is busting at the seams.
  I've used it to solve tons of problems--including writing a web scraper to keep
  track of some client data posted to the web!</p>
