biography: <p>A Python developer looking after 60+ integrations in her day job, Sarah
  is a grad student of data analytics by night (and sometimes weekends) at the Fisher
  College of Business at OSU. Sarah graduated with a BA in International Studies from
  DePaul University and skidded her way into tech via a development-for-non-developers
  Ruby class which got her hooked on puts "Hello World". 10 years of tech experience
  and a few more object-oriented languages later, Sarah is a dedicated Pythonista.
  When managing to pry herself away from her Mac, you can find her hiking the Hocking
  Hills or camping in her tiny camper with her family.</p>
