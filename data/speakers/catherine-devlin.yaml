biography: <p>In 1999, a radioactive database bit Catherine and transformed her from
  a washed-up chemical engineering grad student into a DBA.  She was PyOhio's founding
  chair and PyCon 2018's closing keynote speaker, and is current president of the
  Dayton Dynamic Languages user group.  She lives in the woods near Dayton and probably
