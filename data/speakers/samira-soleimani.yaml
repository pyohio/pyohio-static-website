biography: <p>Samira Soleimani always enjoyed bringing life to spatial and non-spatial
  data, that is why she taught herself coding and statistics while doing her MSC in
  Geospatial Information System (GIS). Then she decided to do a second MSC in Computer
  Science to expand her fundamental understanding about coding, algorithms, data structure,
  machine learning, predictive models, and text mining. Finally following her passion
  in data, she transferred all her knowledge and experiences into a data scientist
  role. Her effective experiences are on data science, machine learning prediction
  models, spatial statistics.</p>
