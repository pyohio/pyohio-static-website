biography: '<p>I have been speaking or presenting at PyCon since I was in fifth grade
  starting out with my Pythonista mom and now on my own! I presented about different
  types of games, teaching, and robotics with Python. I love working with Python,
  especially building neural networks for games I play, and developing neural networks
  for competitions in Kaggle and Data.world.<br />

  Here is a video link from my presentation in PyOhio21: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNaPGZX7Co0&amp;ab_channel=PyOhio">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNaPGZX7Co0&amp;ab_channel=PyOhio</a><br

  I am also part of a Robotics team called the FTC Ninjabots. We participate in seasonal
  robotics competitions. Our design has sections on using  AI to detect objects. I
  use the skills I know from AI and Python experience to make my contribution.<br
