biography: '<p>I have been attending PyCon since 2017. I have presented posters in
  PyCon 2018 and 2019 and I am accepted this year as well! This will be my first time
  at PyOhio and I am excited. It is great fun and a nice way to meet other people
  interested in the same things as you are! </p>
