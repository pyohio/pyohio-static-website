biography: <p>Heidi is a transformation advocate with LaunchDarkly. She delights in
  working at the intersection of usability, risk reduction, and cutting-edge technology.
  One of her favorite hobbies is talking to developers about things they already knew
  but had never thought of that way before. She sews all her presentation shirts so
  they match the pajama pants.</p>
