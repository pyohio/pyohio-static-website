biography: <p>I am a Physicist and a Data Scientist. I work on a diverse range of
  projects, mostly in R and Python, although I dabble in a range of other technologies.
  I enjoy public speaking and delivering training. I strive to make data and code
  more accessible, taking complex concepts and breaking them down into smaller, digestible
  units.</p>
