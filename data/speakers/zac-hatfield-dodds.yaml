biography: '<p>Zac''s modest goal is to help everyone write better code -- mostly
  via bug-finding tools.</p>

  <p>He spends his time working on Hypothesis, Pytest, and other open-source projects;
  along with <a href="https://hypofuzz.com">HypoFuzz</a> and his PhD at the Australian
  National University. And if you can''t <a href="https://zhd.dev">get to him via
  a computer</a>, Zac can probably be found with a good book, a pile of chocolate,
  a long walk in the bush... or all three!</p>'
