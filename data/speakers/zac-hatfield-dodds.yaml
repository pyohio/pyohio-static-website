biography: "md//Zac's modest goal is to help everyone write better code - mostly via\
  \ bug-finding tools.\r\n\r\nHe spends his time working on Hypothesis, Pytest, and\
  \ other open-source projects; along with [HypoFuzz](https://hypofuzz.com) and his\
  \ PhD at the Australian National University. And if you can't [get to him via a\
  \ computer](https://zhd.dev), Zac can probably be found with a good book, a pile\
  \ of chocolate, a long walk in the bush... or all three!"
