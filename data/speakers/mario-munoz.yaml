biography: <p>Mario started learning Python at the very young age of 39, with hardly
  any previous programming experience. That was around 3.5 years ago. Since then,
  he's launched <a href="https://www.pythonbynight.com">Python By Night</a>, a blog
  detailing the journey of learning Python when there's just not enough time during
  the day.</p>
