biography: '<p><a href="https://kattni.com">Kattni</a> is a mentor, maker, open source
  community leader, technical writer, embedded software developer and embedded hardware
  designer. She is proud to be a woman in tech. She is sponsored by Adafruit to work
  on the <a href="https://circuitpython.org">CircuitPython project</a>. She is also
  <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/kattni">sponsored on GitHub</a> by some amazing
  folks who enable her to further share her knowledge.</p>

  <p>Halfway through 2017, Kattni discovered a passion she had never considered, and
  it began a series of events that brought her to the amazing place she now finds
  herself. Her path began with trying to learn Python, and stumbling into CircuitPython.
  She quickly realised the best part about learning so many new things was sharing
  that knowledge with others. This realisation has been fundamental to her journey,
  and has continued to be a significant part of everything she does.</p>

  <p>She spends her time with Adafruit maintaining the <a href="https://circuitpython.org/libraries">CircuitPython
  libraries</a>, coordinating <a href="https://circuitpython.org/contributing">new
  contributors</a>, leading the <a href="https://adafru.it/discord">Adafruit community</a>,
  authoring <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/users/kattni">guides and tutorials</a>,
  and picking up whatever else needs to be done, including sometimes designing hardware
  <a href="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/5378-01.jpg">bearing her name</a>.</p>

  <p>In the rest of her life, she is a maker, programmer, artist, photographer, intermittent
  chef, one-time gardener, and loved partner. She is tolerated by two cats who continue
  to let her live with them.</p>'
