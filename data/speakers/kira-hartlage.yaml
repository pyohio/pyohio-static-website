biography: md//Mechanical design engineer turned embedded software engineer, I bring
  a unique perspective to product design. I began my software journey learning Python
  on my own, and now write mostly in C for consumer appliance microcontrollers. I
  enjoy creating reliable and quality systems, and I believe simple is best and over-complication
  only increases chances of failure.
