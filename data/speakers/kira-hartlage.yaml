biography: <p>Mechanical design engineer turned embedded software engineer, I bring
  a unique perspective to product design. I began my software journey learning Python
  on my own, and now write mostly C code for microcontrollers in consumer appliances.
  Reliability and quality are important to me in everything I do, and I believe simple
  is best and over-complication only increases chances of failure. When I'm not coding,
  I enjoy spending my free time with my husband and daughter, reading, and playing
  Animal Crossing.</p>
