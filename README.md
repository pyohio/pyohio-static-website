[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/85a2eace-1a24-47a3-b6c6-739c9ca43cba/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/pyohio/deploys)

This site is built on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and deploys to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). It serves as the front for everything _not_ related to the CFP process.

## Development

Requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed

1. Clone this repository
2. In a terminal, navigate to the top of this repository and run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn develop` to build the site and start the local server

Prettier is set up as a command that can be run by itself via `yarn prettier --write .`. Please do that before making a PR. (hook coming eventually)
