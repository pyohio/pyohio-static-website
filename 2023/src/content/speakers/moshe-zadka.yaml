biography: <p>Moshe has been involved in the Linux community since 1998, helping in
  Linux "installation parties". They have been programming Python since 1999, and
  have contributed to the core Python interpreter. Moshe has been a DevOps/SRE since
  before those terms existed, caring deeply about software reliability, build reproducibility
  and other such things. They have worked in companies as small as three people and
  as big as tens of thousands -- usually some place around where software meets system
  administration.</p>
