biography: '<p>Rodrigo has always been fascinated by problem solving and that is why
  he picked up programming – so that he could solve more problems. He also loves sharing
  knowledge, and that is why he spends so much time writing articles in his blog <a
  href="https://mathspp.com/blog">mathspp.com/blog</a>, writing on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/mathsppblog">@mathsppblog</a>,
  and giving workshops and courses. You can also find his past talks on <a href="https://github.com/mathspp/talks">github.com/mathspp/talks</a>.</p>

  <p>His main areas of scientific interest are mathematics (numerical analysis in
  particular) and programming in general (with a preference for the Python and APL
  languages), but Rodrigo also enjoys reading fantasy books, watching silly comedy
  movies and eating chocolate.</p>'
