description: '<p>Your documentation is peppered with examples â€“ what if users could
  run them in an interactive REPL, right inside the online documentation? With PyScript,
  developers can add an interactive Python session to any webpage, including integration
  with Sphinx, MkDocs, readthedocs, and GitHub Pages.</p>

  <p>In this talk, you will learn how to enhance your Python web documentation by
  making it fully interactive and runnable anywhere, in a fully serverless way.</p>'
