description: <p>Explore a glacier-inspired approach to understanding and refactoring
  (seemingly) complicated code.  Learn how the glacial retreat can help you understand
  code and codescapes. This intentionally slow-moving method allows the safe reworking
  of scary-looking code through a practical incremental approach. Transform code mountains,
  cliffs, lakes, and caverns into flattened out easy to explore codebase.</p>
