description: <p>PEP 593 introduced the <code>Annotated</code> Type in Python 3.9,
  allowing typing metadata. In 2023, usage of the type by popular libraries has significantly
  increased. For example, <code>FastAPI</code> and <code>Pydantic</code> have fully
  adopted the <code>Annotated</code> type and recommend it as the preferred syntax
  for their functionality.  In this talk, we will explore usage of this type in open
  source projects and take a look at how it might be used in your code.</p>
