description: '<p>Amateur (Ham) Radio is a hobby and service that has been around for
  generations. A lot of the concepts have not changed over the years, but the technologies
  that enable Hams to talk around the world have evolved and developed greatly over
  the years. Ham Radio is all about experimenting and learning new things with electronics
  and software. But what if there is not something that you can find that quite fits
  what you want to be able to do?</p>

  <p>In this talk, we will look at some of the ways that Python can be used to fill
  in some of the gaps and what Python can do to help you in Ham Radio.</p>'
