description: '<p>Async programming can make complex things easy, but at the same time
  be hard to get 100% correct; particularly when it comes to exceptions and handling
  states outside the "happy path". Python has been gaining tools to more easily handle
  the failure cases, notably in 3.11 a new exception handling syntax: <code>except*</code>.</p>

  <p>Don''t know what this does or how to read it? This talk is for you.</p>

  <p>This talk will briefly discuss asyncio and how async code differs from normal
  functions, <code>TaskGroups</code> and when to use them, and finally <code>ExceptionGroups</code>
  and the <code>try: except*:</code> syntax.</p>'
