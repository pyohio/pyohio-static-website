description: <p>The iteration protocol and generators are Python's power tools. Properly
  used, they allow for clearer code that is easier to debug and understand. The talk
  will cover the iteration protocol itself, generator functions and expressions, the
  itertools and more_itertools libraries, and how to use them to up your Python level.</p>
