description: '<p>This talk describes how to use the <code>pytest-ndb</code> package
  for debugging failed pytest tests using a notebook.</p>

  <p>In our opinion, developers should often prefer to debug failing tests using a
  debugger such as pdb. However for certain applications, such as those that occur
  in data science with large complex data sets or long running models, this is can
  be quite difficult. Debugging a failing test can mean having to analyze data, for
  which there is little support in a debugger and where notebooks truly shine.</p>

  <p>Traditionally to debug in a notebook, all of the code from the test, including
  fixtures and parametrizations, must be copied. For simple tests this might not be
  an issue, but for a complex test it can be quite time consuming. Instead, you can
  use <code>pytest-ndb</code>!</p>'
