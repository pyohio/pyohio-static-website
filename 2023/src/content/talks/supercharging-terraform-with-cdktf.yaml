description: '<p>Terraform is great tool for managing infrastructure as code, but
  its default configuration language (HCL) can be inefficient or difficult for more
  advanced or dynamic use cases. Fortunately, we can use the full power of Python
  with the HashiCorp-supported Cloud Development Kit for Terraform.</p>

  <p>In this presentation, I''ll give an example of this power to support an access
  management application, leveraging user profile data in Okta to generate groups
  representing an organization hierarchy, that can respond to organization changes
  with minimal if any code changes needed.</p>'
