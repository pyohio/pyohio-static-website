description: <p>Jupyter notebooks are awesome! They are a great tool for both Python
  beginners and experienced professionals alike. A problem arises when we have to
  "productionize" our Jupyter notebook code into a web service. What if we didn't
  have to rewrite our code to do this? That's where Jupyrest comes in! Jupyrest is
  a library I created to solve this exact problem for my team at Microsoft. In this
  talk I'll show you how you can turn your Jupyter notebooks into a web service without
  any modifications to it. Jupyrest is being used at Microsoft to power hundreds of
  microservices.</p>
