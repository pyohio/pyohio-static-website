description: <p>The swag bags for PyCon 2019 included an Adafruit Circuit Playground
  Express, a lovely little circuit board with many inputs and outputs, and—crucially
  for us—the ability to run Python. With the power of Python and a few other bits
  of software, it’s possible to turn one into your personal “On Air” light. This talk
  will walk the viewer through the steps required to accomplish this, and reference
  related resources for the sake of inspiration. There will be pretty lights.</p>
