description: <p>These days, JavaScript dominates the front-end web ecosystem because
  it is the primary language for the browser. That means you need to use JavaScript
  for dynamic web page interactions, even if your backend is written in a different
  language like Python. However, that's no longer the case! Thanks to <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a>,
  we can develop dynamic interactions directly in hypertext rather than in explicit
  JS code. In this lightning talk, I'll show you how to create a <a href="https://github.com/AutomationPanda/bulldoggy-reminders-app">full-stack
  Python app</a> with FastAPI, HTMX, and a few other Python tools. You will learn
  how to build modern web apps entirely in Python â€“ as well as how HTMX democratizes
  front-end web development!</p>
