# Call for Proposals

> CFP will open in late March and run through May 2 anywhere on earth. Link will be posted here when it opens.

We want to hear from you! PyOhio invites you to submit a proposal for a presentation.
We're looking for talks on all topics of interest to the PyOhio community.

Continuing with the format we've used in 2020-2021, we will be presenting all short talks.
When submitting a proposal you can choose one of two talk types:

* 5 minute: quick introduction or overview of a topic 
* 10-15 minute: more time for some details without a large time committment from presenters or attendees

Talks will be pre-recorded and streamed during the event.
They will be made available for viewing on-demand shortly after streaming.
We will be providing an online venue for discussion and curated Q&A (optional for presenters.)
