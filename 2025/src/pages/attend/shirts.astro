        <h2>Support PyOhio with a T-Shirt Purchase!</h2>
        
        <p>
          Since PyOhio registration is free, unlike many other conferences, we make our t-shirts optional and use the sale as a fundraiser.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Our t-shirts are designed without any sponsor logos, keeping them clean and timeless. <strong>100% of the proceeds from t-shirt sales are donated to the Python Software Foundation</strong> to support future PyOhio events and the broader Python community.
