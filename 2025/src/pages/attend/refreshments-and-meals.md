In addition, there are [water fill stations](https://www.csuohio.edu/sustainability/water-refill-stations) located near the restrooms on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd floors. We suggest bringing your own water bottle!

## Meal Suggestions

There are many places to find food in the area but here are some organizer recommendations:

- **Masthead** - Brewery with pizzas and sandwiches. Great for larger groups because of picnic table seating and individual payment at order time
- **Bombay Chaat** - Casual Indian street fare
- **Sittoo's** - Lebanese dine-in and take-out
- **Mabel's BBQ** - Michael Symon BBQ restaurant on E4th
- **Southern Tier Brewery** - Craft beer and pub fare
