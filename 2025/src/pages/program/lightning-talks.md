# Lightning Talks

_Time TBD_

Lightning Talks are quick 5-minute (hard limit!) talks on any topics of interest to the PyOhio community. Anyone can present a Lightning Talk. Yes, even you! Slides are encouraged but not required!

A sign-up sheet will be posted in the lobby near registration (deadline TBD). Talks will be selected and the order randomized. The talk list will be posted on this page once they are selected.
