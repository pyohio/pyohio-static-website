## About the conference

PyOhio is a weekend multi-track conference for users of and people interested in the Python programming language. It is a volunteer-organized event held for the benefit of the community. The conference includes seminars, discussions, open spaces, and lightning talks. Content ranges from beginner to advanced.

## Why Sponsor PyOhio?

PyOhio attendees include a variety of working professionals, students, academics, and others, who are so passionate about continuous learning and the Python programming language that they will take a weekend of their own time to immerse themselves in Python programming content. Sponsoring PyOhio lets the attendees know that your organization shares these values. Key points of note:

- Approximately 200-300 attendees.
- Many attendees write in Python professionally – some may use other languages but wish to learn more about Python.
- Attendees come from Ohio and surrounding states – some travel from across the country or even internationally.

Attendees will receive positive exposure to your organization including the benefits listed in the prospectus PDF. Your sponsorship dollars will cover the cost of the conference including venue rental, video production, refreshments, badges, web hosting, etc. With your sponsorship support covering our costs we are able to offer free admission to our attendees.
