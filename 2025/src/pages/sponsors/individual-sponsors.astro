      <h2>About Individual Sponsorship</h2>
<p>PyOhio is proud to offer free admission to everyone however the event has significant costs. We need corporate sponsors to cover the bulk of 
  these costs however we've had individuals ask how they can contribute. If you would like to make a financial contribution to PyOhio and would 
  like your contribution to be recognized publicly you may indicate so when donating. You may make a donation of any amount at
  <a href="/register">PyOhio Registration</a>.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>For a $50+ donation, Individual Sponsors get:</strong><p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Their name listed on the sponsors page (optional)</li>
<li>A limited edition PyOhio Supporter sticker at badge pickup</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br/>
<p>If you have already registered for PyOhio, make sure to only select the donation line item. If you would like to keep your donation anonymous,
  leave the "who should we credit" field blank when checking out.</p>
<br/>
<em>Please note:</em>
<br/>
<ul>
  <li>This level is for individuals only.</li>
<li>Names or nicknames only. We reserve the right to remove company or inappropriate names.</li>
<li>Donating doesn't automatically include registration. Be sure to also select a registration if you plan on attending PyOhio</li>
