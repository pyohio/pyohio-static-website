      <h2>About Individual Sponsorship</h2>
      <p>
        PyOhio is proud to offer free admission to everyone however the event has significant costs. We need corporate
        sponsors to cover the bulk of these costs however we've had individuals ask how they can contribute. If you
        would like to make a financial contribution to PyOhio and would like your contribution to be recognized publicly
        you may indicate so when donating. You may make a donation of any amount at the
        <a href="https://ti.to/pyohio/2025">PyOhio Registration site</a>.
      </p>
      <br />
