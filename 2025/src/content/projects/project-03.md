## Project Overview

AccessGuard is a revolutionary web security platform that combines enterprise-grade protection with built-in accessibility compliance checking. The system ensures websites remain secure while maintaining full accessibility, automatically detecting and suggesting fixes for WCAG violations while protecting against security threats.

## Technical Challenges

The primary challenge was implementing security measures that wouldn't interfere with assistive technologies. We developed an innovative approach that maintains strict security while ensuring screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other accessibility tools function perfectly, even during security challenges like CAPTCHA verification.

## Testimonial

> "AccessGuard has transformed how we approach web security. We no longer have to choose between robust security and accessibility - we get both in one solution, and our compliance scores have never been better."

> - Lisa Chen, Director of Digital Accessibility, Global Tech Solutions

Currently expanding into automated accessibility testing and developing AI-powered remediation suggestions.
