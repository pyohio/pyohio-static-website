## Project Overview

FinanceForAll revolutionizes personal banking by making financial tools accessible to everyone. The platform provides screen-reader optimized interfaces, keyboard-only navigation, and simplified layouts for cognitive accessibility, ensuring equal access to banking, investment, and financial planning tools.

## Technical Challenges

The primary challenge was creating complex financial interfaces that remained fully accessible without sacrificing functionality. We developed a modular interface system that adapts to different assistive technologies while maintaining secure banking protocols and real-time market data integration.
