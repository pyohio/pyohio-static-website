biography: '<p>I have been working as a data scientist at <a href="https://8451.com">84.51Â°</a>
  since 2020, where I''ve made a habit of creating Python packages to simplify the
  work for my colleagues, usually with a focus on functional and declarative programming.</p>

  <p>Academically my background is in Math, Statistics, and Physics. At work, I put
  that background to use on a large recommender system that solves a generalized version
  of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem">knapsack problem</a>.</p>

  <p>I live in Cincinnati with my wife Hannah and our dog Rory. Outside of work I
  like to go on hikes, experiment in the kitchen, and get my heart broken by the Browns.</p>'
