biography: <p>I'm an AI scientist at Intuit in California working on the interesting
  and ever-changing fraud detection landscape. I have experience working with recommendation
  systems, deep learning, and anomaly detection. I was previously building NLP models
  at GoDaddy, but I enjoy working with data in general. I'm a Python enthusiast and
  enjoy sharing my learnings with the community - I've previously presented at the
  PyData, Grace Hopper Conference, PyCon US, EuroPython, and GeoPython. When not opposite
  a screen, I can be found frolicking in nature and exploring new trails.</p>
