biography: '<p>In his sordid career, Leon Adato has worked as an actor, bug exterminator,
  wild-animal remover,<br />

  electrician, carpenter, stage-combat instructor, American Sign Language interpreter,
  and Sunday school<br />

  teacher.</p>

  <p>Oh, and he works with computers, starting back in 1989 (when you could get a
  free copy of Windows 286 on twelve 5¼” floppies when you bought a copy of Excel
  1.0). In IT, he’s had jobs as a classroom instructor, course ware designer, desktop
  support tech, sysadmin, and network engineer.</p>

  <p>Then, about 25 years ago, he got involved with monitoring, working with a wide
  range of tools: Tivoli,<br />

  Nagios, Patrol, ZenOss, janky perl scripts, OpenView, SiteScope, SolarWinds, Grafana,
  Zabbix, New Relic, and Kentik. In the course of that work, he''s designed solutions
  for companies that ranged in size from modest (~10 systems); to significant (1,000
  - 5,000 systems); to ludicrous (250,000 systems in 5,000 locations).</p>'
