biography: '<p>Abigail Mesrenyame Dogbe is an Open Source Researcher, Community Builder

  within Open Source communities, particularly engaging the youth in open source initiatives,
  through speaking and organizing events/workshops in both local and international

  with open source skills to address challenges in their communities while building
  practical, real-world experience. Currently, she is actively involved with the Python
  Software Foundation’s Education and Outreach Workgroup and is developing a toolkit
  with resources to help Python community and conference organizers navigate their
