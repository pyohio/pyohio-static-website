biography: <p>Tathagata Dasgupta (T) loves building things — probably too many things.
  By day, T wears two hats, as an Engineering Manager and a Senior Site Reliability
  Engineer for the Low Latency Group at London Stock Exchange Group. Before that,
  he had fun writing Python for autonomous driving, and large scale financial systems.
  Fascinated by computers from an early age, he feels lucky to spend his professional
  life “playing with computers” for a living. Beyond the keyboard, T is passionate
  about building tech communities. During his decade in Chicago, he helped run the
  Chicago Python User Group (ChiPy), launching a volunteer-driven mentorship program,
  designing hands-on coding challenges, and helping ChiPy become one of the most vibrant
  tech communities in the country. When he’s not coding, managing, or mentoring, you’ll
  probably find him hopelessly losing high stake wrestling matches against a four
  year old!</p>
