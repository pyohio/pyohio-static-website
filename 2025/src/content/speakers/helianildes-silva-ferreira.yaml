biography: '<p>Helianildes Silva Ferreira is an Associate Professor at the Federal
  University of Bahia (UFBA), where she has taught in the Institute of Chemistry since
  2015. She holds a PhD in Chemical Engineering from University of Campinas (Unicamp),
  and MSc. and BSc. degrees from the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), with additional
  specialization in automation, cleaner production technologies (GTZ, Germany), and
  R&amp;D (Coppe/UFRJ).</p>

  <p>Her work focuses on process modeling and simulation, artificial neural networks,
  and sustainable innovations in chemical engineering. She is a member of GECIM (Materials
  Engineering and Science Group) and has led projects on biocomposites from coconut
  fiber and PVC, as well as environmental initiatives to reduce water use in interdisciplinary
  labs.</p>

  <p>Beyond the university, Dr. Silva Ferreira served as a course coordinator, research
  project evaluator, and cleaner production consultant for the São Paulo Research
