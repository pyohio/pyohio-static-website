biography: <p>IT-A/V tech in higher education by day, I love working with computers.
  I discovered I wanted my computers to be more bespoke, do the things I want them
  to do and discovered Python as an accessible language to allow me, not a professional
  developer, to create tools for my own needs. I also love college baseball and one
  of my apps supports this obsession.</p>
