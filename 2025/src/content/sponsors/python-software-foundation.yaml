description: The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect,
  and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth
  of a diverse and international community of Python programmers. The majority of
  the PSF's work is focused on empowering and supporting people within the Python
  community. The PSF has active grant programs that support sprints, conferences,
  meet ups, user groups, and Python development efforts all over the world. In addition,
  the PSF underwrites and runs PyCon US, the primary Python community conference.
  Being part of the PSF means being part of the Python community. Recently we changed
  the PSF to an open membership organization, so that everyone who uses and supports
  Python can join. To learn more, visit our website.
