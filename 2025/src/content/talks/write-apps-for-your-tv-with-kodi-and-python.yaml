description: <p>The open-source media player Kodi is designed to play videos and music
  on your TV, but it also comes with a plugin system that is programmable with Python.
  This talk will walk through writing a plugin for your set-top-box running Kodi,
  including packaging, debugging, and dealing with dependencies (there's no pip here).</p>
