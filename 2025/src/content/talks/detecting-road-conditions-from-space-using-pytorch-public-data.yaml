description: '<p>Monitoring the health of city streets and roadways is expensive,
  time-consuming, and often reactive. But what if we could automate part of that process
  using satellite imagery and Python?</p>

  <p>In this talk, we’ll walk through a real-world project that combines transfer
  learning, PyTorch, and publicly available datasets to classify road segment conditions
  (good, fair, poor) from aerial imagery. You''ll learn how to work with messy real-world
  geospatial data, fine-tune a deep learning model using only a small training set
  (~2,000 examples), and overcome common challenges like blurry imagery, inconsistent
  labels, and overfitting.</p>

  <p>This session is practical and code-driven, aimed at data scientists and analysts
  working in mobility analytics, urban development, or infrastructure who want to
  apply machine perception techniques in their work. By the end, you’ll walk away
  with a reusable workflow for analyzing and predicting urban infrastructure quality
  — all using free tools and open data.</p>'
