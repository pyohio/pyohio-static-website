  </blockquote>

  <p>Python’s abstract base classes (ABCs) in the <code>collections.abc</code> module
  provide a powerful way to create objects that behave like built-in data structures
  such as dictionaries, lists, and sets. In this talk, we’ll explore how these abstract
  collections work, why they’re useful, and how they enable seamless integration into
  Python’s ecosystem. Additionally, we will explain the Mixin design pattern and provide
  concrete examples of implementing an abstract collection. This session is perfect
  for attendees looking to learn more about Python''s design philosophy and make their
  code more Pythonic.</p>'
