description: '<p><strong>Description</strong><br />

  Intended to be an entertaining overview of challenges faced and lessons learned
  working on my first big maker project.  Using code snippets, pictures and short
  demos, I will discuss problems overcome while developing new features and integrating
  new devices into my humble animated sign, which includes lights along with rhythmic
  and melodic components.  I promise not to dance; no one wants to see that.</p>

  <p>The intended audience is anyone interested in maker projects.  I will also be
  touching on introductory-level topics in type hinting; the standard library modules
  abc, dataclasses, signal, and threading; and the 3rd-party modules aiohttp, gpiozero,
  and requests.</p>

  <p><code>Note on Photosensitivity:</code><br />

  Based on <a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/stories/shedding-light-photosensitivity-one-epilepsys-most-complex-conditions">this
  epilepsy.com article</a>, this presentation should be safe for any photosensitive
  audience member.  I will include this information in a slide at the beginning of
  the presentation, and give anyone in the audience the chance to leave or ask questions
  before proceeding.</p>

  <ul>

  <li>The sign project uses standard 60 watt incandescent bulbs, which are not capable
  of producing a strobe effect.</li>

  <li>For further safety, during the presentation, bulbs will not cycle on and off
  more than 3 times per second.</li>

  <li>Additionally, the roomâ€™s lighting will not be darkened more than usual for a
  standard presentation.</li>
