description: '<p>ML models behave as a black box in most scenarios. Model predicts
  or provides a certain output but it is very difficult to generate any actionable
  insights directly. This is mostly because we generally have no idea which features
  are contributing the most to the model behavior internally. SHAP provides a certain
  way to explain model predictions, and can act as an important tool in a data scientist’s
  toolbox.</p>

  <p>In this talk, we will begin by explaining to the audience the need for explainable
  ML models and why it is important to understand beyond what the model outputs. We
  will then briefly go over the mathematical intuition behind Shapley values and its
  origins from game theory. After that we will walk through a couple of case studies
  of tree based and neural network based models. We will be focusing on interpretation
  of SHAP through various plots using the shap library in Python. Finally, we will
  discuss the best practices for interpreting SHAP visualizations, handling large
  datasets, and common pitfalls to avoid.</p>'
