  children have to do with writing code? More than you might think.</p>

  <p>Through stories of precision, adaptability, and resilience, I''ll show how non-technical
  experiences have helped me to thrive in tech. From iteration at my forge, troubleshooting
  on the manufacturing floor, and to building empathy as a parent I''ll share how
  life''s lessons have built transferable skills.</p>

  <p>Whether you''re a seasoned professional or a new developer, this session will
  inspire you to embrace your own journey and discover the hidden strengths you can
  bring to the table.</p>'
