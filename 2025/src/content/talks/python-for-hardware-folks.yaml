description: <p>Python is a versatile language, and it’s often the go-to language
  for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and web developers, among others.  However,
  often notably absent from this list are those working on and developing things in
  the physical world.  Too often is the humble hardware engineer forgotten, doomed
  to a fate of spreadsheets.  But what if I told you there was a whole world of hardware-focused
  Python?  This talk will explore various examples of Python in the world of hardware
  folks, including building test fixtures, data acquisition, and industrial automation.  We’ll
  also look at other issues, including what are the alternatives and why adoption
  of Python can be challenging.  This talk is meant for everyone, but especially those
  you love or want to tinker with hardware.</p>
