description: '<p>Getting from "I''m passionate about this topic" to actually working
  in (or on) your dream is a wild leap. Lessons learned from traveling this path the
  hard way, from finding the right niche for your passion project to getting the right
  collaborators on board, can''t be taught in a classroom.</p>

  <p>These are some of the lessons formed over six years of growing an international
  charity from two through to 6000 volunteers across the globe. You''ll learn tips
  on applying Python''s ecosystem of third-party tools to your project''s aim, assembling
  a diverse team that can assess the needs of a diverse world, and using Python-based
  tools to build your dream project.</p>'
