description: '<p>Working in the concrete industry, I often found myself doing tasks
  that felt repetitive. Python has been great for automating these tasks, with the
  goal being to both increase efficiency and remove opportunities for human error,
  which can be costly in this business. Automating things has also taught me that
  seemingly simple tasks can be more complicated than they seem.</p>

  <p>As part of this I will discuss libraries that I have found useful, including
  ezdxf, which can be used for drafting and creating files that can be read by CAD
  software.</p>

  <p>Python really is a programming language for everyone, and can have a use case
  in places you might not expect.</p>'
