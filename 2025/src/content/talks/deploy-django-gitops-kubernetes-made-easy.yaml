description: '<p>Deploying code shouldn’t be stressful. But too often, the journey
  from local dev to production is fragile, manual, and hard to debug. This talk is
  about building peace of mind into your pipeline — with GitOps, Kubernetes, and open
  source tools like Argo CD that make continuous delivery predictable, repeatable,
  and scalable from the very first release to the 50th.</p>

  <p>We’ll tackle the realities of “day two” DevOps — what happens after the first
  deploy. From managing rollbacks and coordinating releases to enforcing consistency
  across dev, staging, and production, you’ll learn how to bring stability and scalability
  to your delivery pipeline.</p>

  <p>In a live demo, we’ll deploy a full stack Django app from GitHub to production
  using Argo CD and GitHub Actions — with observability, rollback strategies, and
  environment parity built in from the start.</p>

  <p><strong>You’ll learn how to:</strong> <br />

  - Set up a GitOps-based CI/CD pipeline that works across all environments<br />

  - Automate rollouts, rollbacks, and version control of infrastructure<br />

  - Understand why Kubernetes is a future-proof platform for Django teams<br />

  - Gain confidence in releasing updates safely, consistently, and at scale<br />

  - Leverage open source tools to eliminate manual deployment headaches</p>

  <p>Whether you''re writing the code or leading the team, you''ll leave with a clear,
  practical blueprint for shipping faster — and with fewer surprises.</p>'
