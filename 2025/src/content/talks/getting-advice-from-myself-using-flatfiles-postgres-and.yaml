description: '<p>Cicero said - there is no one who can give you wiser advice than
  you can give yourself. That''s why when I started generating transcripts from my
  productivity podcast, I decided to start using it to give myself productivity advice
  using ALL of my content.</p>

  <p>This talk dives into a journey using PostgreSQL with pgvector for hybrid search
  as the base for using personal transcriptions, blog posts, and more for RAG and
  AI Agents.</p>'
