  Core python / Concurrency</p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong><br />

  Ever wonder how Python’s iterator protocol connects all the way up to <code>asyncio</code>?</p>

  <p>In this talk, we''ll start with a gentle dive into the fundamentals of iterators,
  generators, coroutines and async coroutines, including how they work at a high level.
  From there, we will follow an exciting journey of a humble customer service line
  — starting with a single agent helping one customer at a time, gradually leveling
  it up into an efficient, concurrent system using generators, coroutines and asyncio.
  Through this journey, we''ll explore how each concept builds on top of the previous
  one, all with clear runnable code.</p>

  <p><strong>Python level:</strong><br />

  Beginner - Intermediate</p>

  <p><strong>Target audience:</strong><br />

  If you are a beginner or an intermediate Python developer curios about Python''s
  async capabilities, aiming to write more idiomatic python code (or just looking
  to flex on your teammates with some cool async python), this talk is for you.</p>'
