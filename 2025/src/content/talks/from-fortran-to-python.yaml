description: '<p>What was it like to write scientific code before personal computers,
  IDEs, or instant feedback loops? In this talk, a mother and son — one who programmed
  in <em>Fortran</em> using punch cards and one who writes <em>Python</em> today in
  modern IDEs — reflect on how programming practices, tools, and mindsets have evolved
  across generations.</p>

  <p>Through personal stories and a short demo of a scientific simulation, we compare
  the experience of coding the same computational model decades apart. This talk is
  less about syntax and more about what has changed (and what hasn’t) in how we approach
  problem-solving, debugging, and scientific thinking in code.</p>

  <p>Whether you''re a veteran programmer or just getting started, join us for a thoughtful,
  engaging, and intergenerational exploration of scientific computing — from punch
  cards to <em>Python</em> notebooks and modern IDEs.</p>'
