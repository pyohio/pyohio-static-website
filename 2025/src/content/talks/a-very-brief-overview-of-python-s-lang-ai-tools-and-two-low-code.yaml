description: '<p>AI is the theme of the moment - and even as a pythonista you might
  not know where to begin, or you may have started as you had time - and wished to
  go further. This talk is a guide about where some have gone, and where you might
  want to go with AI in python. But it is not the last stop. This talk is designed
  to be a stating guide to move from hobbyist level AI learning to more production-ready
  coding.</p>

  <p>Often where you begin is with some of the low-code GUI tools - for instance Flowise
  [ flowiseai.com] - where with a api key and some clicks you can quickly build a
  chatbot - and then you leant to  add complexity - maybe you pull out some embeddable
  code -or start to have more than one agent talk to each other, or with some walk-throughs
  you build a knowledge-base of documents for your bot ( a RAG - Retrieval Augmented
  Generation ) and now it knows - all your recipes. </p>

  <p>Later you want to give your bot some "hands" or rather tools and later you connect
  to N8N [n8n.io] - which is a flexible workflow automation. You''ve made your bot
  reach out into the world to do something (aka made it "Agentic"). </p>

  <p>But then you want more control - and stability - so you look to do what you previously
  did in low-code- directly in python, with a view to production. </p>

  <p>This is when you look to the "Lang" flavor tools: Langchain, Langflow, Langraph,
  and Langsmith. </p>

  <p>Given the time, this will be a very quick tour of these concepts with both images
  and code shown - so it won''t be a line-by line build along. A repo and suggested
  resources will be provided at the end.</p>'
