description: '<p>Discover how to harness the power of IoT to tackle real-world problems
  using affordable and accessible technology. In this talk, you''ll learn how to build
  an IoT system from off-the-shelf components, collect data from sensors, and visualize
  the data to tell compelling stories.</p>

  <p>In this talk I''ll showcase a project where I used a Raspberry Pi, environmental
  sensor, and Python to measure and monitor noise levels. This project demonstrates
  how to design and implement an IoT solution from concept to deployment, including
  using InfluxDB and Grafana for real-time data visualization, all running in Docker.<br
  />

  By the end of this talk, you''ll have the skills to bring various pieces of technology
  together to solve real-world problems. Whether you''re an enthusiast, developer,
  or researcher, this session will inspire you to apply open-source tools and inexpensive
  hardware in innovative ways to address the challenges in your every day life.</p>'
