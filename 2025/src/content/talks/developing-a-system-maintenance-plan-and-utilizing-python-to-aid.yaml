description: <p>Overtime, systems can experience rapid growth and become unstable
  without proper management. Managing that growth while maintaining the system can
  become a challenge. We will explore system maintenance in the context of a Geographic
  Information Systems (GIS) Teamâ€™s plan for GIS system maintenance. We will go over
  the reasons for having a system maintenance plan, the components of our plan, and
  things to consider when making your own maintenance plan.</p>
