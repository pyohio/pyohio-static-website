description: '<p>Python loops are "slow", is a phrase every python programmer has
  heard. For better or worse, it is partially true. This talk breaks down how Python
  executes code and why that creates overhead, especially in tight loops. I''ll also
  explore how tools like NumPy, SIMD, and JIT compilation achieve massive speedups
  by working with the CPU instead of against it.</p>

  <p>You should walk away from this talk with more insight into why loops are slow,
  how python code is executed at a high level, and what you should do about it if
  anything.</p>'
