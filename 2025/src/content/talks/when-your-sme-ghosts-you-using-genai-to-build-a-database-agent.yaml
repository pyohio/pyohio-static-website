description: '<p>Have you ever been handed a mystery database and told, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll figure
  it out‚Äù... with no documentation, no SME, and no time?</p>

  <p>In this session, I‚Äôll share how I turned a frustrating (and very relatable) real-world
  problem into a capstone project for Kaggle''s Gen AI 5 Day Intensive Course with
  Google: building a GenAI-powered Database Documentation Agent using Python, SQLite,
  and the Gemini API ‚Äî aka what I like to call my SME Ghost Protocol.</p>

  <p>I‚Äôll walk through how I used GenAI to automatically generate natural language
  summaries, answer ad-hoc schema questions, and create entity relationship diagrams
  ‚Äî even when human help wasn''t available.</p>

  <p>We''ll dive into the challenges of working with GenAI as a "coding partner,"
  designing prompts like communication plans, and lessons learned the hard way about
  iteration, hallucination, and debugging when you''re flying solo.</p>

  <p>Expect live demos, practical takeaways, a little workplace sarcasm, and ideas
  for how you can launch your own SME Ghost Protocol ‚Äî because sometimes, GenAI is
  the only teammate who shows up.üëª</p>'
