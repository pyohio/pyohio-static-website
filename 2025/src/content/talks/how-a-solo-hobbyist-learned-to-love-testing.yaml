description: '<p>I don’t get paid to write code. I have no boss to answer to. I have
  no partner to work with. Most of the apps I produce are for me to use. When I was
  learning Python with online videos, I was introduced to testing. I found it interesting,
  but it felt time consuming.</p>

  <p>Then I went back to an old app I had written and wanted to re-work. I was lost.
  I couldn’t even figure out where to begin to make it work again. I slowly decided
  to integrate testing into my personal workflow on projects. Then I came upon an
  unexpected benefit: by testing my code in a Django app, I was able to better learn
  what the library was doing to convert a request into a response. I knew the steps,
  but through writing a test with an expected output and seeing the error messages
  on failures, I now intuitively understand how this process works. This talk will
  demonstrate that.</p>'
