  \ this session has been canceled</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Visual Studio Code has become\
  \ a powerhouse for Python development, offering a lightweight yet robust environment\
  \ packed with tools to streamline coding, debugging, and testing. In this talk,\
  \ we’ll dive into the essential VS Code tooling that can turbocharge your Python\
  \ workflow. From setting up the perfect Python environment to leveraging extensions\
  \ for linting, debugging, and Git integration, you’ll leave with practical tips\
  \ to boost productivity and code quality. Whether you’re wrangling data pipelines,\
  \ building web apps, or just tinkering with scripts, this session will show you\
  \ how to make VS Code your Python best friend.<br />\nKey Points:<br />\n    1 \
  \  Setup Basics: Configuring Python interpreters, virtual environments, and workspace\
  \ settings in VS Code.<br />\n    2   Extensions That Matter: Must-haves like Python\
  \ (by Microsoft), Pylance, and Flake8 for autocompletion, type checking, and linting.<br\
  \ />\n    3   Debugging Like a Pro: Using breakpoints, variable inspection, and\
  \ the debug toolbar for painless bug hunting.<br />\n    4   Testing Made Easy:\
  \ Integrating pytest and unittest directly in VS Code with real-time feedback.<br\
  \ />\n    5   Git Integration: Streamlining version control without leaving the\
  \ editor.<br />\n    6   Pro Tips: Custom snippets, Jupyter notebook support, and\
  \ remote development tricks</p>"
