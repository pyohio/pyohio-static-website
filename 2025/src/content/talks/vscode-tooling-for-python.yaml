  \ offering a lightweight yet robust environment packed with tools to streamline\
  \ coding, debugging, and testing. In this talk, we’ll dive into the essential VS\
  \ Code tooling that can turbocharge your Python workflow. From setting up the perfect\
  \ Python environment to leveraging extensions for linting, debugging, and Git integration,\
  \ you’ll leave with practical tips to boost productivity and code quality. Whether\
  \ you’re wrangling data pipelines, building web apps, or just tinkering with scripts,\
  \ this session will show you how to make VS Code your Python best friend.<br />\n\
  Key Points:<br />\n    1   Setup Basics: Configuring Python interpreters, virtual\
  \ environments, and workspace settings in VS Code.<br />\n    2   Extensions That\
  \ Matter: Must-haves like Python (by Microsoft), Pylance, and Flake8 for autocompletion,\
  \ type checking, and linting.<br />\n    3   Debugging Like a Pro: Using breakpoints,\
  \ variable inspection, and the debug toolbar for painless bug hunting.<br />\n \
  \   4   Testing Made Easy: Integrating pytest and unittest directly in VS Code with\
  \ real-time feedback.<br />\n    5   Git Integration: Streamlining version control\
  \ without leaving the editor.<br />\n    6   Pro Tips: Custom snippets, Jupyter\
