description: '<p>Many people drive their cars around all day and never look under
  the hood. Likewise, search is used every day, millions of times, with very little
  thought for how those results appear on your device. While I can''t build a car
  engine from scratch (yet), I can build a search engine! (mostly).<br />

  In this talk, we''ll take a beginner-friendly approach to discussing how search
  engines work under the hood while building one from scratch in Python along the
  way. We''ll discuss some history of search, demonstrate common data structures that
  make search engines fast and effective, and review how we can get results in a meaningful
  order.<br />

  We''ll also take a high-level look at machine learning models and how vector embeddings
  can easily understand similarity and influence search results.<br />

  This talk is for those interested in taking a beginner''s peek under the hood to
  understand some of the techniques used. No prior experience with information retrieval
  requiredâ€”just bring your curiosity about what really happens when you type a query
  into that search bar.</p>'
