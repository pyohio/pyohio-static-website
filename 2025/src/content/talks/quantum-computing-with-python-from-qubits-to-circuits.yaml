description: '<h2>Quantum Computing with Python: From Qubits to Circuits</h2>

  <p>Have you heard the buzz about quantum computing and wondered what it <em>actually</em>
  means? This beginner-friendly talk introduces the fundamentals of quantum computing
  using the language we all love; Python.</p>

  <p>We’ll start by breaking down core quantum concepts like <strong>qubits</strong>,
  <strong>superposition</strong>, <strong>entanglement</strong>, and <strong>quantum
  gates</strong> in simple terms. Then, we’ll bring those ideas to life with real
  code using <a href="https://qiskit.org/">Qiskit</a>, a powerful open-source quantum
  computing framework built in Python.</p>

  <p>You''ll learn how to:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Simulate qubits and quantum circuits</li>

  <li>Visualize quantum states and interference</li>

  <li>Run your own quantum circuits on a real IBM quantum computer (yes, free and
  live!)</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Along the way, we’ll highlight where quantum computing stands today, where Python
  fits in the ecosystem, and how you can get involved; whether you''re a hobbyist,
  educator, or software developer.</p>

  <p>No prior knowledge of quantum mechanics is needed. If you can write a ''for''
  loop, you can build your first quantum circuit.</p>'
