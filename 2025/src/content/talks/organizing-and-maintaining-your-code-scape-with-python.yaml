description: <p>If you're a software engineer, a data scientist, or almost any other
  type of developer, you're probably familiar with the idea of writing well-organized,
  reusable code. Principles like DRY ("Don't Repeat Yourself") and ETC ("Easy to Change")
  are powerful heuristics at the line-by-line level of code. Design concepts like
  modularity, decoupling, MVC ("Model-View-Controller") and "Fat Model, Skinny Controller"
  can help you make software-level organizing decisions. Resources for project-level
  organization (code, data, documentation, etc.) are abundant and growing fast. Putting
  all this together in a useful way can be challenging, but there's no shortage of
  advice, resources, or templates in any of these areas. By comparison, material related
  to effective organization at the level of the coder's file system or source tree
  is sparse, harder to find, or designed for a more general audience. This talk uses
  "code-scape" as an umbrella term to consolidate ideas about organizing files and
  folders, maintaining your codebase, building a second brain, digital filing systems,
  etc. and shares examples of how you can use lightweight Python scripts to help keep
  your code-scape organized, searchable, and safeguarded.</p>
