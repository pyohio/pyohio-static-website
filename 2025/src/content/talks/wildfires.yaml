description: <p>Wildfires have become more frequent nationwide, causing chaos not
  only within fire zones but also affecting communities far away through smoke and
  poor air quality. In this talk, we'll explore the world of wildfires, understanding
  common terminology and clearing up misconceptions. We will explore data sources,
  potential file formats, and essential data fields using fire perimeter data. By
  leveraging Python and Geopandas we will clean a dataset, analyze the cleaned dataset,
  and  finally create compelling visualizations of our wildfire data.</p>
