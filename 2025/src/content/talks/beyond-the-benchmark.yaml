description: '<p><strong>Ever wondered why your team still uses pip when benchmarks
  show alternatives are 10x faster?</strong> The answer lies beyond raw performance
  metrics.</p>

  <p>In this myth-busting session, I''ll reveal surprising insights from analyzing
  thousands of GitHub repositories and real-world implementation case studies. You''ll
  discover why technical superiority doesn''t always translate to organizational success,
  and how to navigate the complex decision landscape of Python dependency management.</p>

  <p>I''ll share:<br />

  - ‚ö° Eye-opening performance comparisons between UV, Poetry, Conda, and pip+pyenv<br
  />

  - üìä Actual adoption statistics that challenge conventional wisdom<br />

  - üíº ROI calculations that factor in both technical AND human costs<br />

  - üõ£Ô∏è A decision framework for selecting the right tool for YOUR specific context</p>

  <p>Whether you''re contemplating a migration, advocating for better tooling, or
  simply curious about the evolving Python ecosystem, you''ll leave with actionable
  insights that balance technical excellence with organizational reality.</p>

  <p>Don''t miss this data-driven exploration of Python''s most underappreciated infrastructure
