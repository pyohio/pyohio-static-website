  <p>Stop wrestling with regular expressions (regex) and complex abstract syntax tree<br
  />

  (AST)-based frameworks to analyze and lint your Python code! Chasten offers an<br
  />

  elegant solution by leveraging XPath expressions to search Python''s abstract<br
  />

  syntax tree, making static code analysis both powerful and accessible. In this<br
  />

  talk, you''ll discover how to implement custom linting rules, enforce coding<br
  />

  standards, and perform sophisticated pattern matching in your Python projects<br
  />

  using a tool designed for both simplicity and flexibility. Whether you''re a<br
  />

  developer tired of writing fragile regex patterns, an instructor validating<br />

  student code, or a project maintainer who wants to ensure code quality, Chasten<br
