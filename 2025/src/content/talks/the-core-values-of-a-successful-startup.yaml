description: "<p>What really makes a startup succeed? It’s not just product-market\
  \ fit or clever tech—it’s the people and the culture they create together. In this\
  \ talk, I’ll share lessons from my journey across three startups at different stages,\
  \ through acquisitions, pivots, and cultural transformations.</p>\n<p>I’ll explore\
  \ the core values that I’ve seen make the biggest difference—not the ones painted\
  \ on walls, but the ones that show up in code reviews, standups, hard conversations,\
  \ and late-night problem solving. We’ll talk about:<br />\n    •   Authenticity\
  \ over performance<br />\n    •   Love and empathy as engineering virtues<br />\n\
  \    •   Presence and trust in high-stakes uncertainty<br />\n    •   Balance, sustainability,\
  \ and knowing when to push or pause<br />\n    •   Grit, growth, and intentionality—what\
  \ it really takes to build something that lasts</p>\n<p>This talk is for anyone\
  \ who wants to build or be part of a values-driven team: engineers, tech leads,\
  \ future founders, or just curious humans trying to build things that matter.</p>"
