description: <p>In the world of open source, community work often begins with passion,
  but to make it sustainable and impactful, we must begin with the end in mind. In
  this keynote, I will reflect on my journey from contributing to Django Girls to
  leading PyLadies Ghana and building inclusive tech communities across Africa. Drawing
  lessons from open source leadership, cultural identity, and personal growth, we
  will explore what it truly means to build communities that outlast us. This talk
  challenges attendees to rethink community involvement not just as volunteering,
  but as systems-building, infused with purpose, clarity, and intention. Through storytelling,
  reflection, and real-world examples, we will experience how every contribution can
  create ripple effects of confidence, leadership, and global impact.</p>
