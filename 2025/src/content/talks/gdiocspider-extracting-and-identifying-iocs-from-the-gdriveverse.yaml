description: "<p>Google Drive in recent years has become one of the most abused platforms\
  \ for threat actors to conduct illegal and malicious activity. Threat actors use\
  \ Google accounts to launch, store, and log malware, effectively turning Drive into\
  \ a command and control center. On the side of legal and ethical activity, Google\
  \ Drive remains a popular platform for security researchers to store these artifacts\
  \ in summarized write-ups and spreadsheets of malicious and illegal activity observed.\
  \ Much like an archaeologist looks for artifacts providing clues of the history\
  \ of civilization, security researchers look for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs),\
  \ which are clues to what a threat actor has done. Security engineers have worked\
  \ across decades to build out tooling to analyze hard drives and network resources;\
  \ however, similar advances to analyze Google Drive resources have remained underdeveloped.\
  \ Along the same line, tools that aggregate and summarize collections of records\
  \ on IOCs stored in Google Drive by researchers are also lacking.<br />\n    The\
  \ GDIOCSpider (Google Drive IOC Spider) provides a tool for both of these use cases.\
  \ This open-source, configurable, Python tool is capable of crawling through an\
  \ entire Google Drive, analyzing its file contents, and searching for various defined\
  \ IOC (Indicators of Compromise) types to extract. This tool outputs a summary of\
  \ all discovered artifacts across all files, erasing the need for security researchers\
  \ to manually sift through cloud stores. Supplementing the compromised account use\
  \ case, the same tool can be used to aggregate IOCs collected in personal or corporate\
  \ Google Drive accounts in the form of case records gathered by security researchers.\
  \ This ‘environment agnostic’ approach is how GDIOCSpider enables security researchers\
  \ to perform efficient IOC research in Google Drive.<br />\n    GDIOCSpider supports\
  \ capabilities for both user accounts and service accounts through the Google Drive\
  \ API. It has allowlist and denylist capabilities for both folders and files to\
  \ prevent access of files with compliance and security restrictions. For those that\
  \ are very interested in performing local IOC analysis and extraction, GDIOCSpider\
  \ contains a build abstract tool ‘IOCFlagger’ within the context of the source code.\
  \ IOCFlagger offers a rich IOC parser that is capable of both loose and strict matching\
  \ for use cases where it is necessary to search within a string, or simply match\
  \ a string to an IOC type exactly. The full suite of tools under the GDIOCSpider’s\
  \ umbrella enables the user or team operating it to enter the “GDriveverse” of Google\
  \ account incident response, and provide meaningful data for case work and research.</p>"
