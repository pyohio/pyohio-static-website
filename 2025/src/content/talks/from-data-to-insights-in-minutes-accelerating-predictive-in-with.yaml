description: '<p>Have you ever wondered how Machine Learning could automate your tasks
  but hesitated due to time constraints or a lack of specialized coding skills? If
  so, this session is for you! </p>

  <p>Traditionally, building predictive models required specialized coding abilities
  and a deep understanding of statistical concepts. However, AutoML simplifies this
  process and can automatically create machine learning models from your data. This
  session will empower you to use a simple, open-source AutoML tool to quickly create
  Python-based machine learning prototypes (using the pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn
  frameworks) without writing any code. A live demonstration will show how AutoML
  seamlessly (i) processes input data, (ii) selects and trains the best algorithms
  for your specific use case, (iii) generates reproducible Python code for easy integration,
  and most importantly, (iv) how to interpret the results. </p>

  <p>Discover how AutoML can turn your transform your data into actionable insights!</p>'
