description: '<p>In this session, we will explore the concept of hyperdimensional
  computing (HDC), a brain-inspired method of computing. We''ll begin by talking about
  neurons and the brain. Through simple Python examples weâ€™ll dive into HDC and answer:
  What it is? How does it work? And, how does it learn? We will review how other researchers
  have applied HDC and demonstrate how it can be used for solving cybersecurity tasks.<br
  />

  Where deep learning fails, HDC excels. No supercomputer? No problem. HDC offers
  interpretability, low energy requirements, robustness to errors, online learning,
  on-device learning, and more. By pushing the difficult calculations into the embedding
  process, learning becomes a cinch. By the end of this talk, attendees will have
  everything they need to teach their own hyperdimensional computing models.</p>'
