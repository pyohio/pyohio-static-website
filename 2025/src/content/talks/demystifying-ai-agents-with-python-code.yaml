description: '<p>Everyone’s talking about AI Agents! But what are they, and how can
  you build them? This talk cuts through the hype. Drawing on a year spent developing
  a GenAI platform, I''ll show you that creating powerful AI Agents is within your
  reach, no advanced degree required.</p>

  <p>We’ll define agents practically: Large Language Models combined with tools and
  memory. Moving beyond the abstract definition, I’ll show you how to build your first
  agent using the OpenAI Python SDK and fundamental Python concepts you’re already
  familiar with: functions, loops, and conditions. From there, I will demonstrate
  how you can use the CrewAI framework to abstract away the boilerplate code, allowing
  for simpler setup of multi-agent systems.</p>

  <p>By the end, you won''t just understand agents; you''ll be equipped and inspired
  to build your own, ready to tackle custom tasks by integrating the APIs that matter
  to you.</p>'
