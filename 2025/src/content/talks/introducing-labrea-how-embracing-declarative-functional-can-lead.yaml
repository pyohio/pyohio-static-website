description: '<p>As a multi-paradigm language, Python gives its users the freedom
  to solve problems in a vast number of ways. However, this freedom comes with a cost:
  we must resist the urge to use quick, unsustainable approaches in order to avoid
  the plague that is software complexity. For many real world problems, using familiar
  techniques like mutable state and imperative programming make it easier to complete
  the task while yielding a more complex codebase. In many cases, functional programming
  offers a way to write simpler code, but the difficulty of committing to it makes
  it impractical or unappealing to developers.</p>

  <p>Inspired by the 2006 paper <a href="https://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf"><em>Out
  of the Tar Pit</em></a>, and the 2011 talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4"><em>Simple
  Made Easy</em></a> by Rich Hickey, <a href="https://github.com/8451/labrea">Labrea</a>
  is a Python framework that seeks to make the happy path one that results in a simpler
  codebase that is functional, declarative, and composable. Learn about how Labrea
  allowed developers at 84.51ยบ (Kroger) to pull the company''s most complicated coupon
  recommender system out of the slow death march of software complexity, and how it
  might help you.</p>'
