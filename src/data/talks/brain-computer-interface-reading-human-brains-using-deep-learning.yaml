description: "md//Idea : Using deep learning to train and build a model that could
  read the human brain\r\n\r\n 1 in 8 people in the US alone suffers from muteness
  today. Statistics related to the number of cases of Autism and other speaking disorder
  is quite disappointing too. In recent years, researchers and scientists have successfully
  used deep learning to read brain signals and translate them into human-readable
  language like English. Hence, Deep learning has given us all the hope to provide
  voiceless the voice."

  biography: "md//Currently, I'm in my third year of under graduation, pursuing Bachelors
    of Science in computer science from Ashoka university, I'm interested and very
    much fascinated in AI, particularly in Applied Deep learning. I have worked on
    few major projects like Cancer detection system, Handwritten digit recognition
    system, AI generative art, autonomous car driving system and currently I'm exploring
    new problem domains to apply my limited Deep learning knowledge.\r\n\r\nGitHub
