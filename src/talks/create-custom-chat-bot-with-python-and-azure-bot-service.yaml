description: "md//With an abundance of chat bot options on the market, it can be hard
  to evaluate which platform is the best fit. Finding an option which has pre-built
  domains and services, but also allows for customization, will help you decrease
  the level of effort and time to implement while still providing complete control
  over the resulting product. \r\n \r\nIn this talk, you will learn how Python NLP
  can be used in conjunction with Azure Chat Bot services to quickly spin up a chat
  bot that can be customized for your specific use case. Gaby Lio will review the
  different options on the market, highlight the benefits of Azure Chat Bot, and finish
  with an architectural overview and quick demo."
