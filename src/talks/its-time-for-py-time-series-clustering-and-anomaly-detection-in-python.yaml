description: "md//Time series data provides helpful insights about trends, seasonality
  and variance in applications varying from finance to the environment to personal
  sensors.  But what do you do when you have hundreds or thousands of time series?\r\n\r\nEnter
  time series clustering. In this talk, Susan Devitt, Senior Data Scientist, will
  introduce two algorithms for time series clustering - Shape Based Distance and Dynamical
  Time Warp - implemented in the python package dtwclust. Taking a real world example
  using daily financial transaction data, she will show you when to consider clustering
  and how it can be used for anomaly detection."
