description: "md//MongoDB is webscale, right? It's a JSON database, it uses map-reduce,
  it's eventually consistent. Oh, and it's insecure.\r\n\r\nLet me take 10 minutes
  to clear up some things: MongoDB is an ACID-compliant database with transactions,
  schemas & relationships. It includes a powerful aggregation query language. MongoDB
  doesn't speak or store JSON, and nowadays it comes with pretty good security defaults
  (we think).\r\n\r\nI'll cover all of this and more, so you know what you need to
  if you're considering MongoDB for your next (or current) project."

  biography: "md//Mark Smith, usually known online as Judy2k, is a Developer Advocate
    for MongoDB.\r\nHe specialises in Python and Rust and sometimes dabbles in Go.\r\nHe's
    interested in systems architecture and scalability.\r\nWhen he's not sitting at
    a computer, you'll probably find him snowboarding, designing things to 3D-print,
    crocheting a hat or building mechanical keyboards."
