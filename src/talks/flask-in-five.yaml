  biography: "md//I am a n openly gay, first generation college graduate, a former
    high school teacher and current full time data scientist and a part-time educator
    at General Assembly. \r\n\r\nYou will find me open and passionate about sharing
    what I know.  Encouraging people to engage their dreams and change their lives
    by building careers in technology, programming and data science is a priority
    in my life.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I am particularly grateful for the opportunity
    that PyOhio provides to so many people across cultures, races, classes, genders
    & identities without the obstacle of expensive conferences fees. Each year I  make
    attending and when so blessed, presenting here a priority before all other conferences
    because for people to succeed in breaking their own glass ceiling they need to
    see themselves reflected in the speakers at the conference."
