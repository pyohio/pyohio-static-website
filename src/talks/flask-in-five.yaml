  biography: "I am a n openly gay, first generation college graduate, a former high
    school teacher and current full time data scientist and a part-time educator at
    General Assembly. \r\n\r\nYou will find me open and passionate about sharing what
    I know.  Encouraging people to engage their dreams and change their lives by building
    careers in technology, programming and data science is a priority in my life.\r\n\r\nAccordingly,
    I am particularly grateful for the opportunity that PyOhio provides to so many
    people across cultures, races, classes, genders & identities without the obstacle
    of expensive conferences fees. Each year I  make attending and when so blessed,
    presenting here a priority before all other conferences because for people to
    succeed in breaking their own glass ceiling they need to see themselves reflected
    in the speakers at the conference."
