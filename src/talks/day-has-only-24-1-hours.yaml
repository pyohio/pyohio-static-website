description: "md//On the first Sunday of November you may get “one more hour of sleep”
  but as well may spend much more time debugging code dealing with the time zones,
  daylight saving time shifts and datetime stuff in general.\r\nWe'll look at a few
  pitfalls you may encounter when working with datetimes in Python. We'll dissect
  the pytz library, explain why it contains over 400 individual time zones while focusing
  on the 29 entries in the USA. We'll also find the reason why pytz is not part of
  the standard Python, why it gets updated so often and why even that won't solve
  all your problems. And no, PEP 615 will not save you either.\r\nTwo centuries of
  short-sighted propaganda and long-term chaos in ten minutes. Maybe that will make
  you want to avoid time zones in your code altogether!"

    I like to discuss the human stuff in the IT: how humans write in their languages,
    how they measure time and fiddle with time zones, and how they can teach the computers
    to do the boring stuff for them.'
