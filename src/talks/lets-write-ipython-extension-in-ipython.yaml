description: "md//IPython is a Python REPL on steroids. It has many features, but
  if they are not enough, you can easily add new ones by writing an extension.\r\nIn
  this talk, I will show you how to write one. We will build a simple code profiler
  that will measure the execution time of each command. And, for an additional challenge,
  I will do everything without closing IPython."
