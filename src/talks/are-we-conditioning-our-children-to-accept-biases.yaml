description: md//Language being the center of human interactions can be used affirmatively
  or destructively. It’s usage forms the basis of our societies, our stories and our
  narratives. When children grow up in a world where the stories consistently entitle
  them or belittle them, they will internalize these beliefs without question. NLP
  considerably automates the analysis that is paramount to setting the world right
  when it comes to these societal beliefs. NLP has the potential to be an excellent
  equalizer. Most children pick up notions from their educational texts and the rules
  at their educational institute. Thus, analyzing, identifying and eliminating cultural
  biases in the literature used to educate would be among the first steps to fostering
  an equal world. This presentation has an interdisciplinary basis, borrowing concepts
  from psychology, linguistics, literature, statistics and computer science.
