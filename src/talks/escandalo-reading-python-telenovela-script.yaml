  biography: md//Political scientist turned coder, Lorena Mesa is a data engineer
    on GitHub's software intelligence systems team, Director and Vice-Chair, Elect
    on the Python Software Foundation, and PyLadies Chicago co-organizer. Lorena's
    time at Obama for America and her subsequent graduate research required her to
    learn how to transform messy, incomplete data into intelligible analysis on topics
    like predicting Latinx voter behavior. It's this unique background in research
    and applied mathematics that drove Lorena to pursue a career in engineering and
    data science. One part activist, one part Star Wars fanatic, and another part
    Trekkie, Lorena abides by the motto to "live long and prosper".
