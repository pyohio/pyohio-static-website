    the World Book Encyclopedia. His addiction continued through the Atari 8-bit computers
    and various Linux and UNIX-based machines. He's straddled the gamut between system

    professional development. His current obsessions are game development and game
    design for both video and tabletop games. He is also the author of The Mediocre
