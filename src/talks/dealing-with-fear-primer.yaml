  biography: Craig Maloney has been interested since he learned about them in the
    World Book Encyclopedia. His addiction continued through the Atari 8-bit computers
    and various Linux and UNIX-based machines. He's straddled the gamut between system
    administrator and developer since the 1990s and currently uses Python for his
    professional development. His current obsessions are game development and game
    design for both video and tabletop games. He is also the author of The Mediocre
    Programmer, a book to help intermediate programmers through the difficult process
    of transforming from beginning programmers to more advanced programmers.
