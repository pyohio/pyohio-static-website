  the PySpark library makes using it no big deal.

  biography: "md//In 1999, Catherine was a washed-up chemical engineering grad student
    when she was bitten by a radioactive database and was transformed into a software
    person.  She fell in love with the Python community at PyCon 2004 and brought
    that love back to Ohio by leading the volunteers for the first PyOhio.  Every
    year she's thrilled to watch it thrive.\r\n\r\nToday she works on big data ETL
    for Disney Streaming Services.  She and her wife live in the woods near Dayton,
    and yes, they did get hit by the Memorial Day tornadoes.  As a ten-year veteran
    of remote work, she welcomes you all to her world."
