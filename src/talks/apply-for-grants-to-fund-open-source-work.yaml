  know such grants existed. I share:\r\n\r\n* sample foundations and funders (such
  as [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/moss), the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/),
  [NLNet](https://nlnet.nl/), and [Comcast](https://innovationfund.comcast.com/))
  who want to fund open source software projects, and how much they're paying out\r\n*
  a quick case study on how the Python Software Foundation got funding from Open Tech
  Fund to [improve security, accessibility, and localization for PyPI](https://wiki.python.org/psf/PackagingWG#Warehouse:_OTF_grant)\r\n*
  key steps in figuring out a good project idea, budgeting, hiring, and submitting\r\n*
  how the new [Project Funding Working Group](https://wiki.python.org/psf/ProjectFundingWG)
