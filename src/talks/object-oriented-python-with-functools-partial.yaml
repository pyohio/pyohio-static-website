description: "md//In Python, **everything** is an object -- `int`s, `bool`s, `class`es,
  and, yes even `function`s. This has many benefits, but it also allows us to write
  un-Pythonic code that is hard to follow.\r\n\r\nThis talk will demonstrate HOWTO
  design Object-Oriented solutions using only functions, built-in data structures,
  and the standard library.\r\n\r\nAfter this talk, attendees will have a better understanding
  of how Python classes `function` behind the scenes."
