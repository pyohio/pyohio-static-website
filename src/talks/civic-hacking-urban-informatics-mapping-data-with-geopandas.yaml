description: "As more and more communities are experiencing rapid urban sprawl, the
  management of infrastructure and resources provided is becoming crucial. Open source
  datasets are imperative to monitoring and implementing change throughout cities;
  in fact, a large majority of these datasets can be mapped spatially. But how can
  you visualize multiple datasets spatially without skills in ArcGIS? This 10 minute
  thunder talk highlights how to harness libraries in Python to visualize data spatially
  through an urban informatics case study on bike sharing systems.  \r\n\r\nMapping
  data geographically at industry level is performed in ArcGIS, but ArcGIS is a complex,
  costly application. Mapping data helps us understand how socio-technical systems
  are disrupted or improved by laws, policies, and infrastructure projects. For example,
  in ArcGIS you can map the percentage of the population within a high-crime neighborhood
  or understand how the location of public transit correlates to a neighborhood’s
  socioeconomic status. But, you can also map this data using libraries in Python.
  \r\n\r\nThis talk is geared towards those who have a basic understanding of data
  science and data visualization, but want to dive deeper into the realms of mapping
  data science for social good. From briefly reviewing methods in Pandas to diving
  deep into methods in GeoPandas, the audience will gain a better understanding of
  how to derive a spatial component from a dataset, how to turn shapefiles into GeoDataFrames
  and plot them, and how to create quantitative and thematic maps."
