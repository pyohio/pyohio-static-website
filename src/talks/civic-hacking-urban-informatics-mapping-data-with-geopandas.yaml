description: "md//As more and more communities are experiencing rapid urban sprawl,
  the management of infrastructure and resources provided is becoming crucial. Open
  source datasets are imperative to monitoring and implementing change throughout
  cities; in fact, a large majority of these datasets can be mapped spatially. But
  how can you visualize multiple datasets spatially without skills in ArcGIS? This
  10 minute thunder talk highlights how to harness libraries in Python to visualize
  data spatially through an urban informatics case study on bike sharing systems.
  \ \r\n\r\nMapping data geographically at industry level is performed in ArcGIS,
  but ArcGIS is a complex, costly application. Mapping data helps us understand how
  socio-technical systems are disrupted or improved by laws, policies, and infrastructure
  projects. For example, in ArcGIS you can map the percentage of the population within
  a high-crime neighborhood or understand how the location of public transit correlates
  to a neighborhoodâ€™s socioeconomic status. But, you can also map this data using
  libraries in Python. \r\n\r\nThis talk is geared towards those who have a basic
  understanding of data science and data visualization, but want to dive deeper into
  the realms of mapping data science for social good. From briefly reviewing methods
  in Pandas to diving deep into methods in GeoPandas, the audience will gain a better
  understanding of how to derive a spatial component from a dataset, how to turn shapefiles
  into GeoDataFrames and plot them, and how to create quantitative and thematic maps."
