description: md//The students who belong to Generation Z or post-millennials have
  access to gadgets such as smartphones even before they go to school. This makes
  them technology savvy and at the same time they get bored easily in traditional
  classroom settings. It becomes necessary to use modern tools and techniques in the
  classroom to engage students in activities. Also governments are promoting “Bring
  Your Own Device (BYOD)” concept in education which can be a boon to those who cannot
  afford a computer or laptop. In this lightning talk I will introduce the QPython
  which can be installed on smartphone to execute Python programs.
