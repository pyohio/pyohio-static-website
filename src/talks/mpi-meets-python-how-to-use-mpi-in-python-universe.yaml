description: "The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a programming paradigm used in
  Parallel applications to allow for communication amongst processes. In order to
  process large amounts of data and efficiently deal with complex operations, the
  Message Passing Interface (MPI) provides primitives optimized specifically to handle
  such cases. The increasing need for applying parallelism to applications with growing
  complexity, is handled through the use of MPI to scale across machines and to efficiently
  utilize all available resources.   \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will detail various
  MPI primitives and delve into their use cases that are applicable for modern-day
  high performance computing needs. We will explore the MPI layer in the realm of
  Python and define available means to utilize MPI with python."
