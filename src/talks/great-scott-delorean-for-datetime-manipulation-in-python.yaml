description: "md//Working with dates and times in Python can lead to frustration,
  heartache, and, ironically, lost time – but it doesn’t have to!  This brief demo
  introduces Delorean, a library constructed to make datetime manipulation in Python
  easier.  Participants will discover how they can use Delorean \r\n- to do datetime
  arithmetic, \r\n- to handle time zone shifts, \r\n- to convert datetimes into human
  language like “3 days from now,” and\r\n- to generate equally spaced datetime intervals."
