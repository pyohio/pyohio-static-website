description: "At the family summer camp, there is no internet, but great childcare.
  I had time to write code, but no way to get packages from PyPI. I learned about
  DevPI, a flexible Python package repository, which scales down to one laptop in
  a summer camp, and up to a proxy for your thousand-person company.\r\n\r\nThe talk
  will cover diverse use cases for DevPI and how to implement them."
