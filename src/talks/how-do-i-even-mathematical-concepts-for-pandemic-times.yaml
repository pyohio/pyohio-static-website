description: "md//Times are *not* normal and this “not normal” is not evenly distributed.
  Our ability to see, process, and work through crisis are all as unique as our individual
  brains and experiences. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll briefly describe how to break
  problems down into mathematical concepts to ground decision making and understand
  the world around us during a global, multifaceted pandemic.\r\n\r\nUsing concepts
  from network science, nonlinear dynamics, and chaos, the audience should walk away
  encouraged to explore more the frameworks that ground them, and give a better understanding
  of the amazing scientifically-based work around the world."

  biography: md//Amanda Casari is an engineering manager on the Google Open Source
    team, where she is leading  research and engineering to better understand open
    source ecosystems.  She has worked in a breadth of cross-functional roles and
    engineering disciplines for the last 18 years, including developer relations,
    data science, complexity science, and robotics.  She creates projects and programs
    to make the data world more responsible and approachable, recently co-authoring
    the O'Reilly book, Feature Engineering for Machine Learning Principles and Techniques
    for Data Scientists.  Amanda is endlessly fascinated by the difference between
    the systems we aim to create and the ones that emerge.
