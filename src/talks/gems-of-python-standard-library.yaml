description: "md//You may know about a lot of the amazing standard libraries such
  as `collections`, `json`, `sqlite3`, `argparse`, etc.\r\n\r\nBut what about the
  more unknown libraries, such as `sched`, `struct`, `enum`, `bisect`, `heapq`, `decimal`,
  `statistics`, `pathlib`, and many more!\r\n\r\nThis talk will go through, at a high
  level, the usage of some of these libraries and how they can allow you to performs
  some tasks more computationally efficient or hack together solutions faster without
  needing additionally third party libraries."
