# PyOhio 2020 Presentation Video Details

Congratulations again on having your talk accepted for PyOhio 2020! We're truly thankful to have you as part of this unusual year of our conference.

This year, we are asking all speakers to deliver a prerecorded video of their talks. This doc will walk you through the essentials.

## How long should my video be?

For PyOhio 2020, we are doing a collection of short talks. To help keep the event on track and running smoothly for all of our remote attendees, we have tighter time requirements than in live events:

* **Lightning Talks** should be between **4 - 5 minutes** in length.

* **Thunder Talks** should be between **9 - 10 minutes** in length.

Please, please, please do not go over the maximum time for your talk! If you go over time, we cannot guarantee that the entire talk will be presented on the stream.

## What format should my video be?

Please deliver your video as an **H264 MP4 at 1920x1080 resolution**.

## When does my video have to be delivered by?

We would like to receive all videos by **23:59:59 EST on Sunday, July 19**. This will give us enough time to pre-screen and process them.

**If it looks like you will not be able to make that date, please contact us at program@pyohio.org** as soon as possible to let us know! This will help keep the program chair's panic level under control. :-)

## How should I deliver my video?

You have two choices for delivering your video:

1. **Upload your video to the private Dropbox folder that will be created for you** (we'll contact everyone separately by email with the link to this folder);
2. **Upload your video to your own cloud sharing service** and send a link to or share it with **program@pyohio.org**; we'll handle downloading it from there.

## How should I record my presentation?

There are lots of ways you might choose to record your presentation. Here are some suggestions that we hope will be useful. Ultimately, whatever path you choose will be fine as long as you can deliver a video in the right format.

### Recording with OBS Studio

OBS Studio is a free, open-source tool used for capturing audio and video; it runs on Mac OS, Windows, and Linux: https://obsproject.com

Here's a guide to capturing both your screen and webcam using OBS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL8BwstqiqE

### Recording with Screenshot.app

Mac OS 10.15 can record videos of the screen with the Screenshot app. Here's a guide to recording your screen with a voiceover in Mac OS 10.15 / Catalina: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nn86t9955Y

### Recording with Keynote

Apple's Keynote can create videos with voiceover narration. Here's a guide to creating a video with voiceover narration using just Keynote: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6e2ZtHnimA

Here's a guide to creating a video with Keynote and combining it with a webcam recording in iMovie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRnANp2kS3c

PowerPoint can also create videos of presentations, optionally including video from a webcam. Here's a guide to creating a video with PowerPoint: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHXRuJEsN7M

### Other Tools

Other tools you might choose include Elgato and Camtasia. If you have recommendations to share with other presenters, let us know and we'll update this list.

## Advice

This is going to be a new and different experience for many speakers. Thank you for your courage! Here are some thoughts we've had that might be helpful as you prepare your video.

### Practice First

We **strongly recommend** that whatever path you take for recording, you should **practice recording before doing your presentation "for real"**. This way you can get comfortable with your choice of tools.

### Have a Script

Have solid notes or a script that you can read from as you record your presentation. It can be a lot harder to be impromptu or to ad lib for a recording than it is to do so in a live room. Having a script of some kind will help prevent you from stumbling or freezing up (things your program chair is prone to do whenever doing voiceover work).

### Maybe Record in Segments

Delivering your presentation to a computer can feel quite different from speaking to a roomful of live attendees. You may find it valuable to record your presentation in shorter segments and assemble them using your favorite video editor.

### Live Coding? Beware Keyboard Sounds!

If you are live coding, using your computer’s built-in microphone may pick up the sound of typing, which can be distracting for your audience. We recommend using an external microphone or headset, or using an external keyboard. **Please review the audio of your recording before submitting it!**
