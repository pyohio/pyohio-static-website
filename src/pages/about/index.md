## The Event

PyOhio is a non-profit annual Python community conference usually held in Columbus, OH and online for 2020. It is free to attend and welcomes anyone with an interest in Python. Content ranges from beginner to advanced and is intended to be relevant to all types of Python users: students, software professionals, scientists, hobbyists, and anyone looking to learn more.

This year's event will consist of 5 and 10-minute talks and sprints.

## OSU Open Source Club

PyOhio is produced in partnership with the Ohio State University Open Source Club.

The Open Source Club is on the forefront of technology and code, pushing the boundaries of tech that respect the users' individual freedoms

Whether you need some help understanding a function, or just someone to bounce ideas off of, there are no better people to talk to than those who are involved in the Open Source Club.
