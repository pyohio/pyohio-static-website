## Register to Attend

<!-- Link to tito here -->

Please register using the link above if you plan on attending PyOhio so we can print a badge for you ahead of time and so we can know how many people to expect.

**Note:** If you find that you will not be able to attend PyOhio after you've registered, please cancel your registration via the "Change Details" link on the ticket email or send a message to [info@pyohio.org](mailto:info@pyohio.org).

### Tutorial Registration

Tutorials are free to attend but they require pre-registration. Registration will open \$date at 12:00pm ET at the registration link above.

**Important:**

- Space is very limited and we ask that you register for no more than one tutorial.
- Please arrive at the room at least 10 minutes before the tutorial start time. Anyone not seated by 5 minutes before the start time will lose their spot.
- We will have a waiting list. Any spots that are open at 5 minutes before the start time will be offered to people present outside the room door in the order they are on the waitlist.
- Some tutorials have prerequisites or installation instructions. Please see the tutorial listing for details.
- If register and find you will not be able to attend, please cancel your registration or email [info@pyohio.org](mailto:info@pyohio.org) so someone on the waiting list can take the spot.
