## Conference Registration

Please register using the link above if you plan on attending PyOhio so we can print a badge for you ahead of time and so we can know how many people to expect.

**Note:** If you find that you will not be able to attend PyOhio after you've registered, please cancel your registration via the "Change Details" link on the ticket email or send a message to info@pyohio.org.
