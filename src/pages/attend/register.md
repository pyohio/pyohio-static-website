If you just want to watch the talks, they will be streaming live on the [PyOhio YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/PyOhio) without requiring registration. In order to participate in chat and sprints, please register using the link above. Information about our chat system will be sent to your registered email address the week before the event.

### T-Shirts

We typically use t-shirt sales as our primary fundraiser. Because the costs of running the virtual event this year are low and because we aren't able to host our Young Coders class, we've decided to use our fundraiser to support an organization that aligns with our mission: [Black Girls CODE](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/).
