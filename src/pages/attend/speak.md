## Call for Proposals - Open Soon!

PyOhio 2020, the annual Python programming conference for Ohio and the surrounding region, will take place Saturday & Sunday July 25th-26th, 2020 at The Ohio Union in Columbus, Ohio.

PyOhio invites all interested people to submit proposals for scheduled talks and tutorials. All topics of interest to the Python community will be considered. Standard presentation talk slots will be 30 minutes with select talks being given 45 minutes. Tutorial slots will be 120 minutes long.

**Proposals accepted through May ?? Anywhere on Earth (08:00am ET 2020-05-??)**

Ready to submit a talk? Create a speaker profile and submit proposal(s) via our CFP site: [cfp.pyohio.org](https://cfp.pyohio.org/2020/dashboard/).

### Session Formats

- **Talks:** 30-minute presentations (with some select talks given an expanded 45-min time)
- **Tutorials:** 120-minute hands-on workshops

Note: We do not include time for Q&A however some speakers may choose to take questions during their session. Speakers can let the Session Chair know and they will make an announcement before the session if that is the case.

### Who Should Submit a Proposal?

You. Your friends. Your friends' friends. Anyone with any level of Python knowledge is a candidate for a great topic at this conference. As we get attendees of all kinds, we need speakers of all kinds. In all ways and manners, we try to assemble the most diverse conference we can, and we do that with your help.

Whether you got started with Python last month or you've been around for 20 years, we think you've got something to share. The Python community is stronger than ever and we're still reaching new areas, new industries, and new users. Be a part of growing Python by helping us change the future.

In particular, we welcome submissions from people that have never done a talk before! And if you want help preparing a talk, let us know! Volunteers are eager to help new people with talks.

You may submit multiple proposals however we will typically only accept one proposal per speaker.

### Financial Aid / Travel Assistance

Unfortunately PyOhio is not able to offer financial aid or travel assistance at this time.

We prioritize for PyOhio to be free to attend so as many people as possible can participate. By doing so we run with a very lean budget. Financial aid is a goal for the future but until we can secure funding for this we are unable to provide it.

### Speakers

PyOhio is dedicated to featuring a diverse and inclusive speaker lineup.

**All speakers will be expected to have read and adhere to the conference [Code of Conduct](/attend/code-of-conduct). In particular for speakers: slide contents and spoken material should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate, and neither are language or imagery that denigrate or demean people based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability, or body size.**

We will make every effort to provide accommodations for speakers and attendees of all abilities&mdash;all we ask is that you let us know so we can prepare accordingly.

PyOhio is a conference in support of the local programmer community. We aim to feature a mix of local and non-local speakers to offer a program with broad appeal.

### Resources

This [public speaking repository](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/Public_Speaking), maintained by [VM Brasseur](https://twitter.com/vmbrasseur), has many useful resources to help you polish your proposals and talks.

You may review last years' talk listings for example abstracts:

- [2019 talks](https://www.pyohio.org/2019/schedule/talks/list/)
- [2019 tutorials](https://www.pyohio.org/2019/schedule/tutorials/list/)
- [2018 talks](https://www.pyohio.org/2018/schedule/talks/list/)
- [2018 tutorials](https://www.pyohio.org/2018/schedule/tutorials/list/)

### Submitting

To help us evaluate proposals and build our program, we would like as much detail as you can provide on your talk. At a minimum this should include: **a brief description (~400 characters) suitable for inclusion in a schedule page; a brief prose abstract (intended as the content for a talk detail page on the program site); and, if you'd like, a rough outline of the structure including estimated timings for each section of your talk.**

If you've given your talk before, links to video or slides would be excellent, or if you've blogged about this topic links to your blog posts would be of use as well.

Your speaker profile includes a space for you to describe your prior experience giving talks&mdash;this is your chance to talk yourself up and explain how you're qualified to share your ideas, so take advantage of it!

### How to Write Your Proposal

If you have an idea and want to speak, here's a very rough process of what you should do next:

- Brainstorm or [mind map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) to expand upon your ideas or knowledge in search of a general topic
- Write a paragraph or two, or some bullet points, to outline the core concepts you want to communicate and what people might learn from your talk
- Get someone you trust to read your notes and tell you what they think they'd learn
- Join us in Slack and discuss it in the #cfp channel: [https://slack.pyohio.org/](https://slack.pyohio.org/)
- Submit your proposal on [cfp.pyohio.org](https://cfp.pyohio.org/2019/dashboard/)
- Practice!

### Questions?

Log into our [Slack team](https://slack.pyohio.org/) and ask in the `#cfp` channel or email us at [info@pyohio.org](mailto:info@pyohio.org).

If you would like to be matched with a mentor to help with your proposal(s), [request a mentor here](https://forms.gle/4tUxujRfhiyTbsf8A).

## Talk/Tutorial Selection Process

PyOhio is using a two-phase review process for 2019. This is intended to allow attendees and others interested in PyOhio to have input in the talk selection decision while leaving the final program curation up to the [Program Committee](/about#the-pyohio-2020-organizing-team).

### Phase One: Ranking of anonymized proposals

During this phase, the reviewers will score each proposal solely on the title, description, and abstract contents. Other proposal fields will be hidden including any identifying information or notes about the speaker(s) proposing the talk.

Anyone interested in helping provide input is invited to
[become a reviewer](#), including anyone who has submitted a proposal. If you have submitted, you will be able to see all submissions except those on which you have been included as a presenter.

### Phase Two: Identity-aware curation and selection

The [Program Committee](/about#the-pyohio-2020-organizing-team) will use the scored proposals in conjunction with speaker profiles to rank and organize a program while ensuring diversity of speakers and topics.

## Reviewing Proposals

PyOhio is a community event and we want the talk selection to represent the interests of the community. To accomplish this we are using a two-phased review process and would like _your_ feedback during phase one. Reviewers of all backgrounds and experience levels are welcome!

**To sign up as a reviewer:**

1. Sign in to your account (or create a new one) on our [CFP site](https://cfp.pyohio.org/).
2. Go to the [CFP site dashboard page](https://cfp.pyohio.org/2020/dashboard/).
3. Scroll to the bottom and look for the Teams box.
4. Click on the ["Proposal Reviewers"](https://cfp.pyohio.org/2020/teams/proposal-reviewers/) team and click Join.

**Once you've joined the team:**

1. Reload the Dashboard screen. You should see a new 'Reviews' section.
2. Read through as many proposals as you can. Sort by total number of reviews and try to review the talks that have the least total reviews first.
3. Use the speaker feedback tab if you want to ask questions, get clarification, or recommend changes to the proposal.

**Scoring:**

Scoring is used during the first round of the selection process to provide the selection committee input on which submissions have the greatest interest. Rate the proposal in its current form and please use the following guidelines for scoring:

- `++`: Good proposal and I would argue for it to be accepted.
- `+`: OK proposal, but I would not argue for it to be accepted.
- `−`: Weak proposal, but I would not argue strongly against acceptance.
- `−−`: Serious issues and I would argue to reject this proposal.

If the submitter updates the proposal you will have the chance to update your score.

**Note:** If you have submitted a proposal, you will not see it listed in reviewer mode. This is so you do not vote on your own proposal. You are encouraged to both propose and review session submissions if you wish.
