## Pre-conference Hackfest

TBD

## Young Coders Class

It's the same class as taught at PyCon! Details: https://us.pycon.org/2017/events/letslearnpython/

Except there's one slight difference: At the end of our class, the kids take everything home but the monitors: Pi, case, power supply, keyboard, mouse, and HDMI cable. They can plug into a flat screen TV and keep on learning.

The class is open to teens from 12-17, and is aimed at kids who have never programmed before. (Seriously, if they are already doing this stuff at home on their own, they'll be bored.)

Exceptions to to the age policy may only be made in advance by the PyOhio Chair in consultation with the class instructor. Exceptions will only be made for children under 12 if they will be entering the 7th grade (US school system) or higher in fall of 2017. Exceptions will only be made for persons over 17 if they have not yet graduated high school (12th grade US school system). Proof of education level may be required. Contact [info@pyohio.org](mailto:info@pyohio.org) if you have questions about this policy.

### Event Schedule

- Friday, July 24, 6:00pm-11:00pm
- Saturday, July 25, 6:30pm-11:00pm

### RSVP

If you plan to attend, please RSVP here so we can get a count for food and refreshments. (You can still attend even if you don't register but pre-registering helps us!)

### Location & Directions

Coming soon!

### More Details

#### Reception

Receptions will include pizza, salad, desserts, and beverages

#### Sprints

For those unfamiliar with the term: sprints are cooperative coding sessions where you work side-by-side with other PyOhio participants to improve an open-source project.

You can:

- Write something new
- Extend an existing package (yours, or someone else's)
- Fix bugs
- Write tests
- Improve documentation

It's a great way to contribute to the community, learn about coding and open-source contribution, and have fun with new and old PyOhio friends.

#### What you need

**Experience not needed** - sprinting is actually a great way to _gain_ experience. Just bring a laptop!

#### Projects

None posted (yet!)

#### Want to lead a sprint?

Add a project to the list announce it in the `#sprints` channel in [PyOhio Slack](https://slack.pyohio.org) or email [info@pyohio.org](mailto:info@pyohio.org) with the information.
